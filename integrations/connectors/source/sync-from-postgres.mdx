You use the {PG_CONNECTOR} to synchronize all data or specific tables from a {PG} database instance to your
{SERVICE_SHORT}, in real time. You run the connector continuously, turning {PG} into a primary database with your
{SERVICE_SHORT} as a logical replica. This enables you to leverage real-time analytics capabilities on
your replica data.

![Connectors overview](https://assets.timescale.com/docs/images/tiger-on-azure/tiger-console-connector-overview.png)

The {PG_CONNECTOR} leverages the well-established {PG} logical replication protocol. By relying on this protocol,
it ensures compatibility, familiarity, and a broader knowledge base—making it easier for you to adopt the connector
and integrate your data.

You use the {PG_CONNECTOR} for data synchronization, rather than migration. This includes:

* Copy existing data from a {PG} instance:
  - Copy data at up to 150 GB/hr.

    You need at least a 4 CPU/16 GB source database, and a 4 CPU/16 GB target {SERVICE_SHORT}.
  - Copy the publication tables in parallel.

    Large tables are still copied using a single connection. Parallel copying is in the backlog.
  - Forget foreign key relationships.

    The connector disables foreign key validation during the sync. For example, if a `metrics` table refers to
    the `id` column on the `tags` table, you can still sync only the `metrics` table without worrying about their
    foreign key relationships.
  - Track progress.

    {PG} exposes `COPY` progress under `pg_stat_progress_copy`.

* Synchronize real-time changes from a {PG} instance.
* Add and remove tables on demand using the [{PG} PUBLICATION interface][pg-publication].
* Enable features such as hypertables, columnstore, and continuous aggregates on your logical replica.
