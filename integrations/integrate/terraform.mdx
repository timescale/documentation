[Terraform][terraform] is an infrastructure-as-code tool that enables you to safely and predictably provision and manage infrastructure.

This page explains how to configure Terraform to manage your {SERVICE_LONG} or {SELF_LONG}.

## Prerequisites

<IntegrationPrereqCloud />
* [Download and install][terraform-install] Terraform.

## Configure Terraform

Configure Terraform based on your deployment type:

<Tabs label="Configure Terraform for your service">

    <Tab title="Tiger Cloud">

        You use the [{COMPANY} Terraform provider][terraform-provider] to manage {SERVICE_LONG}s:

        <Procedure>

            1. **Generate client credentials for programmatic use**

            1. In [{CONSOLE}][console], click `Projects` and save your `Project ID`, then click `Project settings`.

            1. Click `Create credentials`, then save `Public key` and `Secret key`.

            1. **Configure {COMPANY} Terraform provider**

            1. Create a `main.tf` configuration file with at least the following content. Change `x.y.z` to the [latest version][terraform-provider] of the provider.

            ```hcl
            terraform {
            required_providers {
            timescale = {
            source  = "timescale/timescale"
            version = "x.y.z"
        }
        }
        }

            # Authenticate using client credentials generated in Tiger Console.
            # When required, these credentials will change to a short-lived JWT to do the calls.
            provider "timescale" {
            project_id = var.ts_project_id
            access_key = var.ts_access_key
            secret_key = var.ts_secret_key
        }

            variable "ts_project_id" {
            type = string
        }

            variable "ts_access_key" {
            type = string
        }

            variable "ts_secret_key" {
            type = string
        }
            ```

            1. Create a `terraform.tfvars` file in the same directory as your `main.tf` to pass in the variable values:

            ```hcl
            export TF_VAR_ts_project_id="<your-timescale-project-id>"
            export TF_VAR_ts_access_key="<your-timescale-access-key>"
                export TF_VAR_ts_secret_key="<your-timescale-secret-key>"
                    ```

                    1. **Add your resources**

                    Add your {SERVICE_LONG}s or {VPC} connections to the `main.tf` configuration file. For example:

                    ```hcl
                    resource "timescale_service" "test" {
                        name              = "test-service"
                        milli_cpu         = 500
                        memory_gb         = 2
                        region_code       = "us-east-1"
                        enable_ha_replica = false

                        timeouts = {
                        create = "30m"
                    }
                    }

                    resource "timescale_vpc" "vpc" {
                        cidr         = "10.10.0.0/16"
                        name         = "test-vpc"
                        region_code  = "us-east-1"
                    }
                    ```

                    You can now manage your resources with Terraform. See more about [available resources][terraform-resources] and [data sources][terraform-data-sources].

        </Procedure>

    </Tab>

    <Tab title="Self-hosted TimescaleDB">

        You use the [`cyrilgdn/postgresql`][pg-provider] {PG} provider to connect to your {SELF_LONG} instance.

        Create a `main.tf` configuration file with the following content, using your [connection details][connection-info]:

        ```hcl
        terraform {
        required_providers {
        postgresql = {
        source  = "cyrilgdn/postgresql"
        version = ">= 1.15.0"
    }
    }
    }

        provider "postgresql" {
        host            = "your-timescaledb-host"
        port            = "your-timescaledb-port"
        database        = "your-database-name"
        username        = "your-username"
        password        = "your-password"
        sslmode         = "require" # Or "disable" if SSL isn't enabled
    }
        ```

        You can now manage your database with Terraform.
