This page explains how to integrate Decodable with your {SERVICE_LONG} to enable efficient real-time streaming and analytics.

## Prerequisites

<IntegrationPrereqs />

- Sign up for [Decodable][sign-up-decodable].

   This page uses the pipeline you create using the [Decodable Quickstart Guide][decodable-quickstart].

## Connect Decodable to your {SERVICE_LONG}

To stream data gathered in Decodable to a {SERVICE_LONG}:

<Procedure>

1. **Create the sync to pipe a Decodable data stream into your {SERVICE_LONG}** 

   1. Log in to your [Decodable account][decodable-app].
   1. Click `Connections`, then click `New Connection`.
   1. Select a `PostgreSQL sink` connection type, then click `Connect`.
   1. Using your [connection details][connection-info], fill in the connection information.
   
      Leave `schema` and `JDBC options` empty.
   1. Select the `http_events` source stream, then click `Next`.
   
      Decodable creates the table in your {SERVICE_LONG} and starts streaming data.



1. **Test the connection**

   1. Connect to your {SERVICE_LONG}.

      For {CLOUD_LONG}, open an [SQL editor][run-queries] in [{CONSOLE}][open-console]. For {SELF_LONG}, use [`psql`][psql].

   1. Check the data from Decodable is streaming into your {SERVICE_LONG}.

      ```sql
      SELECT * FROM http_events;
      ```
      You see something like:
