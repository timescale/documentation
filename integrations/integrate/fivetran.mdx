[Fivetran][fivetran] is a fully managed data pipeline platform that simplifies ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes
by automatically syncing data from multiple sources to your data warehouse.

![Fivetran data in a service](https://assets.timescale.com/docs/images/integrations-fivetran-sync-data.png)

This page shows you how to inject data from data sources managed by Fivetran into a {SERVICE_LONG}.

## Prerequisites

<IntegrationPrereqs />

* Sign up for [Fivetran][sign-up-fivetran]

## Set your Tiger Cloud service as a destination in Fivetran

To be able to inject data into your {SERVICE_LONG}, set it as a destination in Fivetran:

![Fivetran data destination](https://assets.timescale.com/docs/images/integrations-fivetran-destination-timescal-cloud.png)

1. In [Fivetran Dashboard > Destinations][fivetran-dashboard-destinations], click `Add destination`.
2. Search for the <code>{PG}</code> connector and click `Select`. Add the destination name and click `Add`.
3. In the <code>{PG}</code> setup, add your [{SERVICE_LONG} connection details][connection-info], then click `Save & Test`.

   Fivetran validates the connection settings and sets up any security configurations.
4. Click `View Destination`.

   The `Destination Connection Details` page opens.

## Set up a Fivetran connection as your data source

In a real world scenario, you can select any of the over 600 connectors available in Fivetran to sync data with your
{SERVICE_LONG}. This section shows you how to inject the logs for your Fivetran connections into your {SERVICE_LONG}.

![Fivetran data source](https://assets.timescale.com/docs/images/integrations-fivetran-data-source.png)

1. In [Fivetran Dashboard > Connections][fivetran-dashboard-connectors], click `Add connector`.
2. Search for the `Fivetran Platform` connector, then click `Setup`.
3. Leave the default schema name, then click `Save & Test`.

   You see `All connection tests passed!`
4. Click `Continue`, enable `Add Quickstart Data Model` and click `Continue`.

   Your Fivetran connection is connected to your {SERVICE_LONG} destination.
5. Click `Start Initial Sync`.

   Fivetran creates the log schema in your {SERVICE_SHORT} and syncs the data to your {SERVICE_SHORT}.

## View Fivetran data in your Tiger Cloud service

To see data injected by Fivetran into your {SERVICE_LONG}:

1. In [data mode][portal-data-mode] in {CONSOLE}, select your {SERVICE_SHORT}, then run the following query:
   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM fivetran_log.account
   LIMIT 10;
   ```
   You see something like the following:
