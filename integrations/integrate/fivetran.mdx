[Fivetran][fivetran] is a fully managed data pipeline platform that simplifies ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes 
by automatically syncing data from multiple sources to your data warehouse.

This page shows you how to inject data from data sources managed by Fivetran into a {SERVICE_LONG}.

## Prerequisites

<IntegrationPrereqs />

* Sign up for [Fivetran][sign-up-fivetran]

## Set your {SERVICE_LONG} as a destination in Fivetran

To be able to inject data into your {SERVICE_LONG}, set it as a destination in Fivetran:

1. Search for the `PostgreSQL` connector and click `Select`. Add the destination name and click `Add`.
1. In the `PostgreSQL` setup, add your [{SERVICE_LONG} connection details][connection-info], then click `Save & Test`.

   Fivetran validates the connection settings and sets up any security configurations.
1. Click `View Destination`. 

   The `Destination Connection Details` page opens.

</Procedure>

## Set up a Fivetran connection as your data source

In a real world scenario, you can select any of the over 600 connectors available in Fivetran to sync data with your 
{SERVICE_LONG}. This section shows you how to inject the logs for your Fivetran connections into your {SERVICE_LONG}.

   Your Fivetran connection is connected to your {SERVICE_LONG} destination. 
1. Click `Start Initial Sync`.

   Fivetran creates the log schema in your {SERVICE_SHORT} and syncs the data to your {SERVICE_SHORT}.

</Procedure>

## View Fivetran data in your {SERVICE_LONG} 

To see data injected by Fivetran into your {SERVICE_LONG}:

<Procedure>

1. In [data mode][portal-data-mode] in {CONSOLE}, select your {SERVICE_SHORT}, then run the following query:
   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM fivetran_log.account
   LIMIT 10;
   ```
   You see something like the following:
