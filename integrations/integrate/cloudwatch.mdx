[Amazon CloudWatch][cloudwatch] is a monitoring and observability service designed to help collect, analyze, and act on data from applications, infrastructure, and services running in AWS and on-premises environments.

You can export telemetry data from your {SERVICE_LONG}s with the time-series and analytics capability enabled to CloudWatch. The available metrics include CPU usage, RAM usage, and storage. This integration is available for [Scale and Enterprise][pricing-plan-features] pricing tiers.

This pages explains how to export telemetry data from your {SERVICE_LONG} into CloudWatch by creating a {CLOUD_LONG} data exporter, then attaching it to the {SERVICE_SHORT}.
