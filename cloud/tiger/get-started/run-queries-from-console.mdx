As {CLOUD_LONG} is based on {PG}, you can use lots of [different tools][integrations] to
connect to your {SERVICE_SHORT} and interact with your data.

In {CONSOLE} you can use the following ways to run SQL queries against your {SERVICE_SHORT}:

- [{DATA_MODE_CAP}][run-popsql]: a rich experience powered by {POPSQL}. You can write queries with
  autocomplete, save them in folders, share them, create charts/dashboards, and much more.

- [{SQL_ASSISTANT_SHORT} in the {DATA_MODE}][sql-assistant]: write, fix, and organize SQL faster and more accurately.

- [{SQL_EDITOR} in the {OPS_MODE}][run-sqleditor]: a simple {SQL_EDITOR} in the {OPS_MODE} that lets you run ad-hoc ephemeral
  queries. This is useful for quick one-off tasks like creating an index on a small table or inspecting `pg_stat_statements`.

If you prefer the command line to the {OPS_MODE} {SQL_EDITOR} in {CONSOLE}, use [psql][install-psql].

## 	Data mode 

You use the {DATA_MODE} in {CONSOLE} to write queries, visualize data, and share your results.

![{CONSOLE} {DATA_MODE}](https://assets.timescale.com/docs/images/tiger-cloud-console/tiger-cloud-data-mode-schema-chart.png)

Available features are:

- **Real-time collaboration**: work with your team directly in the {DATA_MODE} query editor with live presence and multiple
   cursors.
- **[Schema browser][schema-browser]**: understand the structure of your {SERVICE_SHORT} and see usage data on tables and columns.
- **[{SQL_ASSISTANT_SHORT}][sql-assistant]**: write, fix, and organize SQL faster and more accurately using AI.
- **Autocomplete**: get suggestions as you type your queries.
- **[Version history][version-history]**: access previous versions of a query from the built-in revision history, or connect to a git repo.
- **[Charts][charts]**: visualize data from inside the UI rather than switch to Sheets or Excel.
- **[Schedules][schedules]**: automatically refresh queries and dashboards to create push alerts.
- **[Query variables][query-variables]**: use Liquid to parameterize your queries or use `if` statements.
- **Cross-platform support**: work from [{CONSOLE}][portal-data-mode] or download the [desktop app][popsql-desktop] for macOS, Windows, and Linux.
- **Easy connection**: connect to {CLOUD_LONG}, {PG}, Redshift, Snowflake, BigQuery, MySQL, SQL Server, [and more][popsql-connections].

### Connect to your {SERVICE_LONG} in the data mode

<Procedure>

To connect to a {SERVICE_SHORT}:

1. **Check your {SERVICE_SHORT} is running correctly**

   In [{CONSOLE}][services-portal], check that your {SERVICE_SHORT} is marked as `Running`:

   ![Check {SERVICE_LONG} is running](https://assets.timescale.com/docs/images/tiger-cloud-console/tiger-cloud-console-services-view.png)

1. **Connect to your {SERVICE_SHORT}**

   In the [{DATA_MODE}][portal-data-mode] in {CONSOLE}, select a {SERVICE_SHORT} in the connection drop-down:

   ![Select a connection](https://assets.timescale.com/docs/images/tiger-cloud-console/tiger-cloud-data-mode-connection-dropdown.png)

1. **Run a test query**

   Type `SELECT CURRENT_DATE;` in `Scratchpad` and click `Run`:

   ![Run a simple query](https://assets.timescale.com/docs/images/tiger-cloud-console/run-query-in-scratchpad-tiger-cloud.png)

Quick recap. You:
- Manage your {SERVICE_SHORT}s in the [{OPS_MODE} in {CONSOLE}][portal-ops-mode]
- Manage your data in the [{DATA_MODE} in {CONSOLE}][portal-data-mode]
- Store configuration and security information in your config file.

</Procedure>

Now you have used the {DATA_MODE} in {CONSOLE}, see how to easily do the following:

- [Write a query][write-query]
- [Share a query with your teammates][share-query]
- [Create a chart from your data][create-chart]
- [Create a dashboard of multiple query results][create-dashboard]
- [Create schedules for your queries][create-schedule]

### Data mode FAQ

#### What if my service is within a vpc?

If your {SERVICE_LONG} runs inside a {VPC}, do one of the following to enable access for the {POPSQL} desktop app:

- Use {POPSQL}'s [bridge connector][bridge-connector].
- Use an SSH tunnel: when you configure the connection in {POPSQL}, under `Advanced Options` enable `Connect over SSH`.
- Add {POPSQL}'s static IPs (`23.20.131.72, 54.211.234.135`) to your allowlist.

#### What happens if another member of my {PROJECT_LONG} uses the {DATA_MODE}?

The number of {DATA_MODE} seats you are allocated depends on your [{PRICING_PLAN}][pricing-plan-features].

#### Will using the {DATA_MODE} affect the performance of my {SERVICE_LONG}?

There are a few factors to consider:

1. What instance size is your {SERVICE_SHORT}?
1. How many users are running queries?
1. How computationally intensive are the queries?

If you have a small number of users running performant SQL queries against a
{SERVICE_SHORT} with sufficient resources, then there should be no degradation to
performance. However, if you have a large number of users running queries, or if
the queries are computationally expensive, best practice is to create
a [{READ_REPLICA}][read-replica] and send analytical queries there.

If you'd like to prevent write operations such as insert or update, instead
of using the `tsdbadmin` user, create a read-only user for your {SERVICE_SHORT} and
use that in the {DATA_MODE}.

## {SQL_ASSISTANT_SHORT}

{SQL_ASSISTANT_SHORT} in [{CONSOLE}][portal-data-mode] is a chat-like interface that harnesses the power of AI to help you write, fix, and organize SQL faster and more accurately. Ask {SQL_ASSISTANT_SHORT} to change existing queries, write new ones from scratch, debug error messages, optimize for query performance, add comments, improve readabilityâ€”and really, get answers to any questions you can think of.


### Key capabilities

{SQL_ASSISTANT_SHORT} offers a range of features to improve your SQL workflow, including:

- **Real-time help**: {SQL_ASSISTANT_SHORT} provides in-context help for writing and understanding SQL. Use it to:

  - **Understand functions**: need to know how functions like `LAG()` or `ROW_NUMBER()` work? {SQL_ASSISTANT_SHORT} explains it with examples.
  - **Interpret complex queries**: {SQL_ASSISTANT_SHORT} breaks down dense queries, giving you a clear view of each part.

- **Error resolution**: {SQL_ASSISTANT_SHORT} diagnoses errors as they happen, you can resolve issues without leaving your editor. Features include:

### Limitations to keep in mind

For best results with {SQL_ASSISTANT_SHORT}:

* **Schema awareness**: {SQL_ASSISTANT_SHORT} references schema data but may need extra context
  in complex environments. Specify tables, columns, or joins as needed.
* **Business logic**: {SQL_ASSISTANT_SHORT} does not inherently know specific business terms
  such as active user. Define these terms clearly to improve results.

### Security, privacy, and data usage

Security and privacy is prioritized in {CONSOLE}. In [{DATA_MODE}][portal-data-mode], {PROJECT_SHORT} members
manage {SQL_ASSISTANT_SHORT} settings under [`User name` > `Settings` > `SQL Assistant`][sql-editor-settings].

![SQL assistant settings](https://assets.timescale.com/docs/images/sql-editor-preferences.png)

{SQL_ASSISTANT_SHORT} settings are:

* **Opt-in features**: all AI features are off by default. Only [members][project-members] of your {PROJECT_LONG}
  can enable them.
* **Data protection**: your data remains private as {SQL_ASSISTANT_SHORT} operates with strict security protocols. To provide AI support, {CONSOLE_LONG} may share your currently open SQL document, some basic metadata about your database, and portions of your database schema. By default, {CONSOLE_LONG} **does not include** any data from query results, but you can opt in to include this context to improve the results.
* **Sample data**: to give the LLM more context so you have better SQL suggestions, enable sample data sharing in the {SQL_ASSISTANT_SHORT} preferences.
* **Telemetry**: to improve {SQL_ASSISTANT_SHORT}, {COMPANY} collects telemetry and usage data, including prompts, responses, and query metadata.

## {OPS_MODE_CAP} {SQL_EDITOR}

{SQL_EDITOR} is an integrated secure UI that you use to run queries and see the results
for a {SERVICE_LONG}.
