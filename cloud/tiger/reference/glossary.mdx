## C

**Candlestick Chart**: a financial visualization showing open, high, low, and close (OHLC) values for asset price movements over time intervals.

**CDC (Change Data Capture)**: a pattern that captures changes in database tables and streams them to other systems in real-time, implemented through tools like Debezium.

**{CHUNK_CAP}**: a child table in a {HYPERTABLE} that contains data for a specific time range, automatically managed by {TIMESCALE_DB} for partitioning.

**{CHUNK_CAP} Compression**: the process of converting {CHUNK}s from {ROWSTORE} to {COLUMNSTORE} format to achieve up to 90% storage reduction and improve query performance.

**Chunk Interval**: the time span that determines how data is partitioned into chunks, typically configured as a time duration. For example 7 days.

**{CHUNK_SKIPPING_CAP}**: an optimization technique that allows queries to skip {CHUNK}s that don't contain relevant data based on metadata.

**{COLUMNSTORE_CAP}**: the compressed, columnar storage format in {HYPERCORE_CAP} that optimizes data for analytical queries and reduces storage requirements.

**Connection Pooling**: a technique that optimizes database connections by efficiently managing and reusing them, reducing overhead for high-concurrency applications.

**{CAGG_CAP}s (CAggs)**: materialized views that automatically refresh in the background as new data is added, providing pre-computed aggregations for faster analytical queries.

## D

**Data Tiering**: a storage strategy that automatically moves data between high-performance storage and low-cost object storage based on access patterns and age.

**Debezium**: an open-source distributed platform for change data capture that enables real-time streaming of database changes.

**Dual-Write and Backfill**: a migration strategy for large-scale workloads that involves implementing dual writes to both source and target systems while backfilling historical data.

## F

**Fork**: an exact copy of a database at a specific point in time that operates independently after creation, used for testing or troubleshooting.

## H

**{HA_REPLICA_CAP}s**: exact, up-to-date copies of your database hosted in multiple AWS availability zones that automatically take over if the primary node fails.

**Hierarchical {CAGG_CAP}s**: CAggs built on top of other CAggs. For example seconds → minutes → hours → daily to reduce computational costs for multi-level aggregations.

**{HYPERCORE_CAP}**: {TIMESCALE_DB}'s hybrid row-columnar storage engine that seamlessly switches between row-oriented and column-oriented storage for optimal performance.

**{HYPERTABLE_CAP}**: a PostgreSQL table optimized for time-series data that automatically partitions data by time into {CHUNK}s for improved performance.

## I

**Iceberg Tables**: an open table format for large analytical datasets that enables reliable data lake functionality with ACID transactions.

**Insights**: {CLOUD_LONG}'s built-in query monitoring tool that captures per-query statistics in real-time, providing visibility into database performance.

**{IO_BOOST}**: an add-on feature that provides enhanced IOPS and bandwidth performance for demanding workloads.

**IoT (Internet of Things)**: physical objects with embedded computing capabilities that collect sensor data and generate time-series datasets.

## L

**Live Migration**: an end-to-end migration solution that moves databases with minimal downtime using PostgreSQL logical replication and pgcopydb.

**{LIVESYNC_CAP}**: a feature that enables continuous real-time synchronization between a PostgreSQL source database and {SERVICE_LONG}.

**Logical Replication**: a PostgreSQL feature that replicates changes to database objects based on their replication identity, used for real-time data streaming.

## M

**Materialized View**: a database object that contains the results of a query and can be refreshed to update the data, used in continuous aggregates.

**Multi-tenancy**: a system architecture that enables multiple users (tenants) to share the same application or database while keeping their data isolated.

## O

**Object Storage**: low-cost, scalable storage service built on Amazon S3 used for storing infrequently accessed data in {CLOUD_LONG}'s tiered storage architecture.

**OHLCV**: open, High, Low, Close, Volume - standard financial data points used in market analysis and candlestick charts.

## P

**pgcopydb**: a PostgreSQL tool used for copying databases efficiently, particularly in live migration scenarios.

**PITR (Point-in-Time Recovery)**: a backup feature that allows restoration of a database to any specific point in time within the retention period.

**{PRICING_PLAN_CAP}**: service tiers ({PERFORMANCE}, {SCALE}, {ENTERPRISE}) that determine available features, resources, and support levels in {CLOUD_LONG}.

## R

**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: an AI technique that combines retrieval of relevant information with generation capabilities to provide more accurate responses.

**{READ_REPLICA_CAP}**: a read-only copy of the primary database kept in sync for scaling read operations and analytical workloads.

**Read Replica Sets**: an improved version of read replicas that allows up to 10 replica nodes behind a single read endpoint for horizontal read scaling.

**Real-time Analytics**: the capability to process and analyze data as it's generated, providing immediate insights and enabling quick decision-making.

**Rollup Compression**: a feature that combines multiple smaller, uncompressed {CHUNK}s into a single, larger compressed {CHUNK} to reduce storage costs.

**{ROWSTORE_CAP}**: the uncompressed, row-oriented storage format in {HYPERCORE_CAP} optimized for transactional operations and recent data access.

## S

**Schema per Tenant**: a multi-tenancy approach where each tenant's data is isolated within its own database schema while sharing the same database instance.

**Segmentby**: a configuration option in hypertables that determines how data is segmented, typically using frequently queried columns for optimization.

**Service**: a managed database instance in {CLOUD_LONG} that provides PostgreSQL functionality extended with {TIMESCALE_DB} capabilities.

**Service per Tenant**: a multi-tenancy model where each tenant gets a dedicated {SERVICE_LONG} for complete data isolation.

## T

**{TIME_BUCKET_CAP}**: a function that aggregates data by time intervals. For example 5-minute, 1-hour buckets for time-series analysis.

**Time-series Data**: data that represents how a system, process, or behavior changes over time, typically timestamped and sequential.

**{TIGER_POSTGRES}**: the underlying technology platform that powers {CLOUD_LONG} services with enhanced PostgreSQL capabilities.
