As we enhance our offerings and align them with your evolving needs,
{PRICING_PLAN}s provide more value, flexibility, and efficiency for your business.
Whether you're a growing startup or a well-established enterprise, our plans
are structured to support your journey towards greater success.

{PRICING_PLAN_CAP}s give you:

* **Enhanced performance**: with increased CPU and storage capacities, your apps run smoother and more
  efficiently, even under heavy loads.
* **Improved scalability**: as your business grows, so do your demands. {PRICING_PLAN_CAP}s scale with
  you, they provide the resources and support you need at each stage of your growth. Scale up or down 
  based on your current needs, ensuring that you only pay for what you use.
* **Better support**: access to enhanced support options, including production support and dedicated
  account management, ensures you have the help you need when you need it.
* **Greater flexibility**: we know that one size doesn't fit all. {PRICING_PLAN_CAP}s give you the
  flexibility to choose the features and support levels that best match your business
  and engineering requirements. The ability to add features like {IO_BOOST}, and customize your {PRICING_PLAN} means you can tailor {SERVICE_LONG}s to fit your specific needs.
* **Cost efficiency**: by aligning our pricing with the value delivered, we ensure that you get the most
  out of every dollar spent. Our goal is to help you achieve more with less.

Using {SELF_LONG} and our open-source products is still free. 

If you create a {ACCOUNT_LONG} from AWS Marketplace, the pricing options are pay-as-you-go and annual commit. See [AWS pricing][aws-pricing] for details. 

This page explains pricing plans for {CLOUD_LONG}, and how to easily manage your {ACCOUNT_LONG}.

## How pricing plans work

{PRICING_PLAN_CAP}s are designed to give you the best value as your project moves 
from initial development through to mission-critical enterprise applications. 

* **Compute**: pay only for the compute resources you run. Compute is metered on an hourly 
   basis, and you can scale it up and down at any time. You can also scale out using replicas 
  as your application grows. We even provide services to help you lower your compute needs 
  while improving query performance.

* **Storage**: pay only for the storage you consume. Storage is metered on your average GB 
   consumption per hour; it grows and shrinks automatically with your data. You have 
   high-performance storage for more-accessed data, and [low-cost bottomless storage][data-tiering] 
   for other data. We can help you compress your data up to 10x or more so you pay even less.
   For easy upgrades, each {SERVICE_SHORT} stores the {TIMESCALE_DB} binaries. This contributes up to 900 
   megabytes to overall storage, which amounts to less than $.80/month in additional storage costs.

* **It’s that simple**: you don't pay for backups or networking costs, such as data ingest 
   or egress. There are no per-query fees, nor additional costs to read or write data. It's all completely 
   transparent, easily understood, and up to you.
  
### {CLOUD_LONG} free trial for the different price plans

We offer new users a free, 30-day trial period of our {PERFORMANCE} plan with no credit card required.  
During your trial, you can contact {CONTACT_SALES} to request information about, and access
to, our {SCALE} plan to determine how it fits your needs. During your trial, if a {SERVICE_SHORT} doesn’t receive any queries for 7 days, it is paused to conserve resources. Your data remains intact during the trial, and you can easily resume your {SERVICE_SHORT} in {CONSOLE}. After your trial ends, we may remove your data unless you’ve added a payment method.

After you have completed your 30-day trial period on the {PERFORMANCE} plan, choose the 
[{PRICING_PLAN}][plan-features] that suits your business and engineering needs. 

After you become a paying user, we can enable some features in the higher {PRICING_PLAN}s so you can test them before upgrading. 

### Upgrade or downgrade your pricing plans at any time

You can easily upgrade or downgrade between the {PERFORMANCE} and {SCALE} plans 
whenever you want using [{CONSOLE}][cloud-login]. If you switch your {PRICING_PLAN} mid-month, 
your prices are prorated to when you switch. Your {SERVICE_SHORT}s are not interrupted when you switch, so 
you can keep working without any hassle. To move to {ENTERPRISE}, [get in touch with {COMPANY}][contact-company].

### Monitor usage and costs

You keep track of your monthly usage in [{CONSOLE}][cloud-billing]. {CONSOLE}_SHORT shows your 
resource usage and dashboards with performance insights. This allows you to closely monitor your 
{SERVICE_SHORT}s’ performance, and any need to scale your {SERVICE_SHORT}s or upgrade your {PRICING_PLAN}.

{CONSOLE}_SHORT also shows your month-to-date accrued charges, as well as a forecast of your expected 
month-end bill. Your previous invoices are also available as PDFs for download.

### {COMPANY} support 

{COMPANY} runs a global support organization with Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) scores above 99%.
Support covers all timezones, and is fully staffed at weekend hours. 

All {PRICING_PLAN}s have free Developer Support through email with a target response time of 1 business 
day; we are often faster. If you need 24x7 responsiveness, talk to us about 
[Production Support][production-support].

### Don’t worry about storage or sizing

Unlike Amazon RDS or self-managed infrastructure where you pre-provision your disk and pay for
its allocation, {COMPANY} charges by the actual storage used. As your data volume grows, you can upgrade to as much as 64TB and 32,000 IOPS. 

We make it easy for you to store unlimited amounts of data using tiered storage; a high-performance
storage tier and a low-cost bottomless storage tier. You can keep up to 64TB compressed (typically 80-100TB uncompressed) in the high-performance storage tier, and move less-frequently accessed data to our low-cost storage tier built on S3.

<TieredStorageBilling />

{CLOUD_LONG} is very efficient and generally needs less compute than other databases to deliver
the same performance. The best way to size your needs is to sign up for a free trial and test
with a realistic workload.

### Charging for HA and read replicas

HA and {READ_REPLICA}s are both charged at the same rate as your primary {SERVICE_SHORT}s, based on the 
compute and primary storage consumed by your replicas. Data tiered to our bottomless storage 
tier is shared by all database replicas; replicas accessing tiered storage do not add to your 
bill.

### Charging over regions

Storage is priced the same across all regions. However, compute prices vary depending on the 
region. This is because our cloud provider (AWS) prices infrastructure differently based on region.

## Example billing calculation

You are billed at the end of each month in arrears, based on your actual usage that month. Your monthly invoice 
includes an itemized cost accounting for each {SERVICE_LONG} and any additional charges.

{CLOUD_LONG} charges are based on consumption: 

- **Compute**: metered on an hourly basis. You can scale compute up and down at any time.  
- **Storage**: metered based on your average GB consumption per hour. Storage grows and shrinks automatically 
  with your data.

Your monthly price for compute and storage is computed similarly. For example, over the last month your
{SERVICE_LONG} has been running compute for 500 hours total:
  - 375 hours with 2 CPU 
  - 125 hours 4 CPU 
   
**Compute cost** = (`375` x `hourly price for 2 CPU`) + (`125` x `hourly price for 4 CPU`)  
 
Some add-ons such as Elastic storage, Tiered storage, and Connection pooling may incur 
additional charges. These charges are clearly marked in your billing snapshot in {CONSOLE}.

## Manage your {CLOUD_LONG} {PRICING_PLAN}
