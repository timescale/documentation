To start using {CLOUD_LONG} for your data:

1. [Create a {ACCOUNT_LONG}][create-an-account]: register to get access to {CONSOLE} as a centralized point to administer and interact with your data.
1. [Create a {SERVICE_LONG}][create-a-service]: that is, a {PG} database instance, powered by [{TIMESCALE_DB}][timescaledb], built for production, and extended with cloud features like transparent data tiering to object storage.
1. [Connect to your {SERVICE_LONG}][connect-to-your-service]: to run queries, add and migrate your data from other sources.

<Install />

## Create a Tiger Cloud service

Now that you have an active {ACCOUNT_LONG}, you create and manage your {SERVICE_SHORT}s in {CONSOLE}. When you create a {SERVICE_SHORT}, you effectively create a blank {PG} database with additional {CLOUD_LONG} features available under your {PRICING_PLAN}. You then add or migrate your data into this database.

<Procedure>

1. In the [{SERVICE_SHORT} creation page][create-service], choose the capability to match your business needs: `Real-time analytics`, `AI-focused`, or `Hybrid applications`.

   ![Create a {SERVICE_LONG}](https://assets.timescale.com/docs/images/tiger-cloud-console/create-tiger-cloud-service.png)

1. Follow the next steps in `Create a service` to configure the region, compute size, environment, availability, connectivity, and {SERVICE_SHORT} name. Then click `Create service`.

   Your {SERVICE_SHORT} is constructed and ready to use in a few seconds.

1. Click `Download the config` and store the configuration information you need to connect to this {SERVICE_SHORT} in a secure location.

   This file contains the passwords and configuration information you need to connect to your {SERVICE_SHORT} using the
   {CONSOLE} {DATA_MODE}, from the command line, or using third-party database administration tools.

If you choose to go directly to the {SERVICE_SHORT} overview, [Connect to your {SERVICE_SHORT}][connect-to-your-service]
shows you how to connect.

</Procedure> 

## Connect to your service

To run queries and perform other operations, connect to your {SERVICE_SHORT}:
