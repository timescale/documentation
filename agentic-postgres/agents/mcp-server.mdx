{MCP_LONG} provides access to your {CLOUD_LONG} resources through Claude and other AI Assistants. {MCP_SHORT}
mirrors the functionality of {CLI_LONG} and is integrated directly into the {CLI_SHORT} binary. You manage your
{CLOUD_LONG} resources using natural language from your AI Assistant. As {MCP_SHORT} is integrated with the
{COMPANY} documentation, ask any question and you will get the best answer.

This page shows you how to install {CLI_LONG} and set up secure authentication for {MCP_SHORT}, then manage the
resources in your {ACCOUNT_LONG} through {MCP_LONG} using your AI Assistant.

## Prerequisites

<RESTPrereqs />

- Install an AI Assistant on your developer device with an active API key.

  The following AI Assistants are automatically configured by {MCP_LONG}: `claude-code`, `cursor`, `windsurf`, `codex`, `gemini/gemini-cli`, `vscode/code/vs-code`.
  You can also [manually configure][manual-config] {MCP_SHORT}.

## Install and configure {MCP_SHORT}

{MCP_SHORT} is bundled with {CLI_LONG}:

<CLIINSTALL />

1. **Configure your AI Assistant to interact with the {PROJECT_SHORT} and {SERVICE_SHORT}s in your {ACCOUNT_LONG}**

   For example:
   ```shell
   tiger mcp install
   ```

1. **Choose the client to integrate with, then press `Enter` **

   ```shell
   Select an MCP client to configure:

   > 1. Claude Code
   2. Codex
   3. Cursor
   4. Gemini CLI
   5. VS Code
   6. Windsurf

   Use ↑/↓ arrows or number keys to navigate, enter to select, q to quit
   ```

And that is it, you are ready to use {MCP_LONG} to manage your {SERVICE_SHORT}s in {CLOUD_LONG}.

## Manage the resources in your {ACCOUNT_LONG} through your AI Assistant

Your AI Assistant is connected to your {ACCOUNT_LONG} and the {COMPANY} documentation, you can now use it to
manage your {SERVICE_SHORT}s and learn more about how to implement {CLOUD_LONG} features. For example:

1. **Run your AI Assistant**
   ```shell
   claude
   ```
   Claude automatically runs {MCP_SHORT} server that enables you to interact with {CLOUD_LONG} from your
   AI Assistant.

1. **Check your {MCP_LONG} configuration**
   ```shell
   > is the tigerdata mcp server active for you?
   ```
   You see something like:
   ```shell
   MCP server is active. I can see the following Tiger Data-related tools available:

   - mcp__tiger__get_guide - Retrieve TimescaleDB guides and best practices
   - mcp__tiger__semantic_search_postgres_docs - Search PostgreSQL documentation
   - mcp__tiger__semantic_search_tiger_docs - Search Tiger Cloud and TimescaleDB documentation
   - mcp__tiger__tiger_service_create - Create new database services
   - mcp__tiger__tiger_service_list - List all database services
   - mcp__tiger__tiger_service_show - Show detailed service information
   - mcp__tiger__tiger_service_update_password - Update service passwords

   Is there something specific you'd like to do with the Tiger Data MCP server?
   ```

1. **Ask a basic question about your {SERVICE_SHORT}s**
   ```shell
   > can you list my active services please
   ```
   You see something like:
   ```shell
   ⏺ You have 3 active services, all with the same name "my-first-service":

   1. tgrservice1 - READY - TimescaleDB - us-east-1 - 1 CPU/4GB - Created: 2025-09-30
   2. tgrservice1 - READY - TimescaleDB - us-east-1 - 1 CPU/4GB - Created: 2025-09-30
   3. tgrservice1 - READY - TimescaleDB - us-east-1 - 1 CPU/4GB - Created: 2025-09-30
   ```

1. **Manage your {SERVICE_SHORT}s without having to learn how to**

   For example:
   ```shell
   Can you create a new ai service called bob with a replica for me please
   ```
   You see something like:
   ```shell
    tiger - Create Database Service (MCP)(name: "bob", addons: ["ai"], replicas: 1, wait: false)
   ```

1. **Find best practice for things you need to do**

   For example:
   ```shell
   >  I need to migrate a database with 25 million rows of data to Tiger Cloud,
   please tell me what service optimizations i should do before migration.

   ```

   You see something like:

   ```shell
   ⏺ For migrating a database with 25 million rows to Tiger Cloud, here are the key service optimizations to do before migration:

   Pre-Migration Service Optimizations

   1. Right-size your compute resources:
     - For 25M rows, start with at least 2 CPU/8GB or 4 CPU/16GB
     - You can scale up during migration if needed, then scale down after

   2. Enable the appropriate addons:
     - Use time-series addon if you are working with time-series data
     - Use ai addon if you need vector/AI capabilities

   3. Choose optimal region:
     - Select the region closest to your current database to minimize network transfer time
     - This significantly reduces migration duration

   4. Consider enhanced storage (Enterprise only):
     - If you expect high write throughput during migration, enhanced storage provides better IOPS (up to 32,000)

   5. Skip replicas initially:
     - Start with 0 replicas during migration
     - Add replicas after migration completes to avoid duplicate data copying

   6. Plan for storage space:
     - Estimate your uncompressed data size
     - Allocate sufficient high-performance storage (scales automatically but good to plan)
     - You can enable tiered storage later for older data

   During Migration Best Practices

   Migration method selection:
     - 25M rows: Use schema-then-data migration (migrate schema first, then copy data in chunks)
     - Allows restart if a copy operation fails
     - Better for databases >10GB

   Database configuration to set AFTER migration:
     - Set up compression policies (once data is loaded)
     - Configure retention policies
     - Create continuous aggregates
     - Enable tiered storage for cost optimization

   Connection settings:
     - Use the pooled connection endpoint for better performance during bulk inserts
     - Disable unnecessary constraints/indexes during migration, re-enable after

   Would you like me to help you create an optimized service for this migration?
   ```

That beats working. Let {MCP_SHORT} do it all for you.

## Manually configure {MCP_SHORT}

If your MCP client is not supported by `tiger mcp install`, follow the client's instructions to install
MCP servers. For example, many clients use a JSON file like the following that use `tiger mcp start` to
start {MCP_LONG}:

```json
{
   "mcpServers": {
      "tiger": {
         "command": "tiger",
         "args": [
            "mcp",
            "start"
         ]
      }
   }
}
```
