## Contribute to the TigerData docs

To make the contribution yourself:

    - No write access? [Fork this repository][github-fork].
    - Already have a write access? [Clone this repository][github-clone].

2. Create a branch from `latest`, make your changes, and raise a pull request back to `latest`.

3. Sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA).

   You have to sign the CLA only the first time you raise a PR. This helps to ensure that the community is free to use your contributions.

4. Review your changes.

   The documentation site is generated in a separate private repository using [Gatsby][gatsby]. Once you raise a PR for any branch, GitHub **automatically** generates a preview for your changes and attaches the link in the comments. Any new commits are visible at the same URL. If you don't see the latest changes, try an incognito browser window. Automated builds are not available for PRs from forked repositories.

See the [Contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for style and language guidance.
