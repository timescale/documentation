[{HYPERCORE_CAP}][hypercore] is the hybrid row-columnar storage engine in {TIMESCALE_DB} used by {HYPERTABLEs}. Traditional
databases force a trade-off between fast inserts (row-based storage) and efficient analytics 
(columnar storage). {HYPERCORE_CAP} eliminates this trade-off, allowing real-time analytics without sacrificing
transactional capabilities.

{HYPERCORE_CAP} dynamically stores data in the most efficient format for its lifecycle:

* **Row-based storage for recent data**: the most recent chunk (and possibly more) is always stored in the {ROWSTORE},
   ensuring fast inserts, updates, and low-latency single record queries. Additionally, row-based storage is used as a 
   writethrough for inserts and updates to columnar storage.
* **Columnar storage for analytical performance**: chunks are automatically compressed into the {COLUMNSTORE}, optimizing
   storage efficiency and accelerating analytical queries.

Unlike traditional columnar databases, {HYPERCORE} allows data to be inserted or modified at any stage, making it a
flexible solution for both high-ingest transactional workloads and real-time analyticsâ€”within a single database.
