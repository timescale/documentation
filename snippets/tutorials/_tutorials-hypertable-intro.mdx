{HYPERTABLE_CAP}s are {PG} tables in {TIMESCALE_DB} that automatically partition your time-series data by time. Time-series data represents the way a system, process, or behavior changes over time. {HYPERTABLE_CAP}s enable {TIMESCALE_DB} to work efficiently with time-series data. Each {HYPERTABLE} is made up of child tables called chunks. Each chunk is assigned a range of time, and only contains data from that range. When you run a query, {TIMESCALE_DB} identifies the correct chunk and runs the query on it, instead of going through the entire table.

Because {TIMESCALE_DB} is 100% {PG}, you can use all the standard {PG} tables, indexes, stored procedures, and other objects alongside your {HYPERTABLE}s. This makes creating and working with {HYPERTABLE}s similar to standard {PG}.
