### Set up your data for geospatial queries

To add geospatial analysis to your ride count visualization, you need geospatial data to work out which trips 
originated where. As {TIMESCALE_DB} is compatible with all Postgres extensions, use [PostGIS][postgis] to slice 
data by time and location.

<Procedure>

1.  Connect to your [{SERVICE_LONG}][in-console-editors] and add the PostGIS extension:

    ```sql
    CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
    ```
 
1. Add geometry columns for pick up and drop off locations:

    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE rides ADD COLUMN pickup_geom geometry(POINT,2163);
    ALTER TABLE rides ADD COLUMN dropoff_geom geometry(POINT,2163);
    ```

1.  Convert the latitude and longitude points into geometry coordinates that work with PostGIS: 

    ```sql
    UPDATE rides SET pickup_geom = ST_Transform(ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(pickup_longitude,pickup_latitude),4326),2163),
       dropoff_geom = ST_Transform(ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(dropoff_longitude,dropoff_latitude),4326),2163);
    ```
    This updates 10,906,860 rows of data on both columns, it takes a while. Coffee is your friend.  

</Procedure>

### Visualize the area where you can make the most money

In this section you visualize a query that returns rides longer than 5 miles for 
trips taken within 2 km of Times Square. The data includes the distance travelled and
is `GROUP BY` `trip_distance` and location so that Grafana can plot the data properly.

This enables you to see where a taxi driver is most likely to pick up a passenger who wants a longer ride, 
and make more money.

<Procedure>

1. **Create a geolocalization dashboard**
 
   1. In Grafana, create a new dashboard that is connected to your {SERVICE_LONG} data source with a Geomap
      visualization.
 
   1. In the `Queries` section, select `Code`, then select the Time series `Format`.

   1. To find rides longer than 5 miles in Manhattan, paste the following query:

       ```sql
       SELECT time_bucket('5m', rides.pickup_datetime) AS time,
              rides.trip_distance AS value,
              rides.pickup_latitude AS latitude,
              rides.pickup_longitude AS longitude
       FROM rides
       WHERE rides.pickup_datetime BETWEEN '2016-01-01T01:41:55.986Z' AND '2016-01-01T07:41:55.986Z' AND
         ST_Distance(pickup_geom,
                     ST_Transform(ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(-73.9851,40.7589),4326),2163)
         ) < 2000
       GROUP BY time,
                rides.trip_distance,
                rides.pickup_latitude,
                rides.pickup_longitude
       ORDER BY time
       LIMIT 500;
       ```
       You see a world map with a dot on New York.
   1. Zoom into your map to see the visualization clearly.  

1. **Customize the visualization**

   1. In the Geomap options, under `Map Layers`, click `+ Add layer` and select `Heatmap`.
     You now see the areas where a taxi driver is most likely to pick up a passenger who wants a
     longer ride, and make more money.
