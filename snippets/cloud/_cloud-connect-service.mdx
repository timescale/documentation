Quick recap. You:
- Manage your {SERVICE_SHORT}s in the [{OPS_MODE}][portal-ops-mode] in {CONSOLE}: add {READ_REPLICA}s and enable
  high availability, compress data into the {COLUMNSTORE}, change parameters, and so on.
- Analyze your data in the [{DATA_MODE}][portal-data-mode] in {CONSOLE}: write queries with
  autocomplete, save them in folders, share them, create charts/dashboards, and much more.
- Store configuration and security information in your config file.
