## Create your first service

A {MST_SERVICE_SHORT} in {MST_LONG} is a cloud instance on your chosen
cloud provider, which you can install your database on.

<Procedure>

    ### Creating your first MST service

    1.  [Sign in][mst-login] to your {MST_CONSOLE_LONG}.
    1.  Click `Create service` and choose `TimescaleDB`, and update your preferences:

    <img class="main-content__illustration"
         src="https://assets.timescale.com/docs/images/mst/new-service.png"
         alt="Create a new service in the Managed Service for TimescaleDB portal"/>

    *   In the `Select Your Cloud Service Provider` field, click your
    preferred provider.
    *   In the `Select Your Cloud Service Region` field, click your preferred
    server location. This is often the server that's physically closest
    to you.
    *   In the `Select Your Service Plan` field, click your preferred plan,
    based on the hardware configuration you require. If you are in your
    trial period, and just want to try the {MST_SERVICE_SHORT} out, or develop a proof
    of concept, we recommend the `Dev` plan, because it is the most
    cost-effective during your trial period.
    1.  In the information bar on the right of the screen, review the settings you
    have selected for your {MST_SERVICE_SHORT}, and click `Create Service`. The {MST_SERVICE_SHORT}
    takes a few minutes to provision.

</Procedure>

## Connect to your MST service from the command prompt

When you have a {MST_SERVICE_SHORT} up and running, you can connect to it from your local
system using the `psql` command-line utility. This is the same tool you might
have used to connect to {PG} before, but if you haven't installed it yet,
check out the [installing psql][install-psql] section.

<Procedure>

1.  [Sign in][mst-login] to your {MST_CONSOLE_SHORT}.
1.  In the `Services` tab, find the {MST_SERVICE_SHORT} you want to connect to, and check it is marked as `Running`.
1.  Click the name of the {MST_SERVICE_SHORT} you want to connect to see the connection  information. Take a note of the `host`, `port`, and `password`.
1.  On your local system, at the command prompt, connect to the {MST_SERVICE_SHORT}, using your own {MST_SERVICE_SHORT} details:

    ```bash
    psql -x "postgres://tsdbadmin:<PASSWORD>@<HOSTNAME>:<PORT>/defaultdb?sslmode=require"
    ```

    If your connection is successful, you'll see a message like this, followed
    by the `psql` prompt:

    ```bash
    psql (13.3, server 13.4)
    SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.3, cipher: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, bits: 256, compression: off)
    Type "help" for help.
    defaultdb=>
    ```
</Procedure>

## Check that you have the TimescaleDB extension

{TIMESCALE_DB} is provided as an extension to your {PG} database, and it is
enabled by default when you create a new service on {MST_LONG} You can check that the {TIMESCALE_DB} extension is installed by using
the `\dx` command at the `psql` prompt. It looks like this:

```sql

defaultdb=> \dx

List of installed extensions
-[ RECORD 1 ]------------------------------------------------------------------

defaultdb=>

```

## Where to next
Now that you have your first service up and running, you can check out the
[{MST_LONG}][mst-docs] section in the documentation, and
find out what you can do with it.
