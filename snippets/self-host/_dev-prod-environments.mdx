**Development and production environments**

The following instructions are for development and testing installations. For a production environment, we strongly recommend that you implement the following, many of which you can achieve using {PG} tooling:

- Incremental backup and database snapshots, with efficient point-in-time recovery
- High availability replication, ideally with nodes across multiple availability zones
- Automatic failure detection with fast restarts, for both non-replicated and replicated deployments
- Asynchronous replicas for scaling reads when needed
- Connection poolers for scaling client connections
- Zero-down-time minor version and extension upgrades
- Forking workflows for major version upgrades and other feature testing
- Monitoring and observability

Deploying for production? With a {CLOUD_LONG} service we tune your database for performance and handle scalability, high availability, backups, and management, so you can relax.
