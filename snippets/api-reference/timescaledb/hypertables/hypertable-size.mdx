import { HYPERTABLE, HYPERTABLE_CAP, CHUNK, CHUNK_CAP, CAGG } from '/snippets/vars.mdx';

Get the total disk space used by a {HYPERTABLE} or {CAGG},
that is, the sum of the size for the table itself including {CHUNK}s,
any indexes on the table, and any toast tables. The size is reported
in bytes. This is equivalent to computing the sum of `total_bytes`
column from the output of `hypertable_detailed_size` function.

<Note>
When a {CAGG} name is provided, the function
transparently looks up the backing {HYPERTABLE} and returns its statistics
instead.
</Note>

For more information about using {HYPERTABLE}s, including {CHUNK} size partitioning,
see the [hypertable section][hypertable-docs].

## Samples

Get the size information for a {HYPERTABLE}.

```sql
SELECT hypertable_size('devices');

 hypertable_size
-----------------
           73728
```

Get the size information for all {HYPERTABLE}s.

```sql
SELECT hypertable_name, hypertable_size(format('%I.%I', hypertable_schema, hypertable_name)::regclass)
  FROM timescaledb_information.hypertables;
```

Get the size information for a {CAGG}.

```sql
SELECT hypertable_size('device_stats_15m');

 hypertable_size
-----------------
           73728
```

## Arguments

|Name|Type| Default | Required | Description|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|`hypertable`|REGCLASS| - | ✔ |{HYPERTABLE} or {CAGG} to show size of.|

## Returns

|Name|Type|Description|
|-|-|-|
|hypertable_size|BIGINT|Total disk space used by the specified {HYPERTABLE}, including all indexes and TOAST data|

<Note>

`NULL` is returned if the function is executed on a non-{HYPERTABLE} relation.
