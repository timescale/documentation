{HYPERCORE_CAP} is a hybrid row-columnar storage engine in {TIMESCALE_DB}. It is designed specifically for
real-time analytics and powered by time-series data. The advantage of {HYPERCORE} is its ability
to seamlessly switch between row-oriented and column-oriented storage, delivering the best of both worlds:

{HYPERCORE_CAP} solves the key challenges in real-time analytics:

- High ingest throughput
- Low-latency ingestion
- Fast query performance
- Efficient handling of data updates and late-arriving data
- Streamlined data management

{HYPERCORE_CAP}'s hybrid approach combines the benefits of row-oriented and column-oriented formats:

- **Fast ingest with {ROWSTORE}**: new data is initially written to the {ROWSTORE}, which is optimized for
  high-speed inserts and updates. This process ensures that real-time applications easily handle
  rapid streams of incoming data. Mutability—upserts, updates, and deletes happen seamlessly.

- **Efficient analytics with {COLUMNSTORE}**: as the data **cools** and becomes more suited for
  analytics, it is automatically converted to the {COLUMNSTORE}. This columnar format enables
  fast scanning and aggregation, optimizing performance for analytical workloads while also
  saving significant storage space.

- **Faster queries on compressed data in {COLUMNSTORE}**: in the {COLUMNSTORE} conversion, {HYPERTABLE}
  {CHUNK}s are compressed by up to 98%, and organized for efficient, large-scale queries. Combined with [chunk skipping][chunk-skipping], this helps you save on storage costs and keeps your queries operating at lightning speed.

- **Fast modification of compressed data in {COLUMNSTORE}**: just use SQL to add or modify data in the {COLUMNSTORE}.
   {TIMESCALE_DB} is optimized for superfast INSERT and UPSERT performance.

- **Full mutability with transactional semantics**: regardless of where data is stored,
  {HYPERCORE} provides full ACID support. Like in a vanilla {PG} database, inserts and updates
  to the {ROWSTORE} and {COLUMNSTORE} are always consistent, and available to queries as soon as they are
  completed.
