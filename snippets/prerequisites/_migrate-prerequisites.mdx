import { SERVICE_LONG, SERVICE_SHORT, PG } from '/snippets/vars.mdx';

Best practice is to use an [Ubuntu EC2 instance][create-ec2-instance] hosted in the same region as your
{SERVICE_LONG} to move data. That is, the machine you run the commands on to move your
data from your source database to your target {SERVICE_LONG}.

Before you move your data:

- Create a target {SERVICE_LONG}.

  Each {SERVICE_LONG} has a single {PG} instance that supports the
  most popular extensions. {SERVICE_LONG}s do not support tablespaces,
  and there is no superuser associated with a {SERVICE_SHORT}.
  Best practice is to create a {SERVICE_LONG} with at least 8 CPUs for a smoother experience. A higher-spec instance
  can significantly reduce the overall migration window.

- To ensure that maintenance does not run while migration is in progress, best practice is to adjust the maintenance window.
