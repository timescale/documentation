import { SERVICE_LONG, PG, PG_CONNECTOR } from '/snippets/vars.mdx';

To follow the steps on this page:

* Create a target {SERVICE_LONG} with real-time analytics enabled.

  You need your [connection details](/integrations/find-connection-details).

- Install the [{PG} client tools](/integrations/integrate/psql) on your sync machine.

- Ensure that the source {PG} instance and the target {SERVICE_LONG} have the same extensions installed.

  The {PG_CONNECTOR} does not create extensions on the target. If the table uses column types from an extension,
    first create the extension on the target {SERVICE_LONG} before syncing the table.
