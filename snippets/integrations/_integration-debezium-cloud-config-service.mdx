import { SERVICE_LONG, CLOUD_LONG, CONSOLE, SERVICE_SHORT } from '/snippets/vars.mdx';

1. **Connect to your {SERVICE_LONG}**

   For {CLOUD_LONG}, open an [SQL editor][run-queries] in [{CONSOLE}][open-console]. For self-hosted, use [`psql`][psql].

1. **Enable logical replication for your {SERVICE_LONG}**

   1. Run the following command to enable logical replication:

      ```sql
      ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_level = logical;
      SELECT pg_reload_conf();
      ```

   1. Restart your {SERVICE_SHORT}.

1. **Create a table**

   Create a table to test the integration. For example:

     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE sensor_data (
     id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
     device_id TEXT NOT NULL, 
     temperature FLOAT NOT NULL,
     recorded_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
     );
     ```
