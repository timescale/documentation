import { VPC, CONSOLE, CLOUD_LONG, SERVICE_SHORT, SERVICE_LONG } from '/snippets/vars.mdx';

1. **Create a Peering {VPC} in [{CONSOLE}][console-login]**

   1. In `Security` > `VPC`, click `Create a VPC`:

      ![{CLOUD_LONG} new {VPC}](https://assets.timescale.com/docs/images/tiger-cloud-console/add-peering-vpc-tiger-cloud.png)

   1.  Choose your region and IP range, name your VPC, then click `Create VPC`:

       ![Create a new VPC in {CLOUD_LONG}](https://assets.timescale.com/docs/images/tiger-cloud-console/configure-peering-vpc-tiger-cloud.png)

       Your {SERVICE_SHORT} and Peering {VPC} must be in the same AWS region. The number of Peering {VPC}s you can create in your project depends on your [pricing plan][pricing-plans]. If you need another Peering {VPC}, either contact [support@tigerdata.com](mailto:support@tigerdata.com) or change your plan in [{CONSOLE}][console-login].

   1.  Add a peering connection:

       1. In the `VPC Peering` column, click `Add`.
       1. Provide your AWS account ID, Transit Gateway ID, CIDR ranges, and AWS region. {CLOUD_LONG} creates a new isolated connection for every unique Transit Gateway ID. 
       
         ![Add peering](https://assets.timescale.com/docs/images/tiger-cloud-console/add-peering-tiger-cloud.png)
 
       1. Click `Add connection`.

1. **Accept and configure peering connection in your AWS account**

   Once your peering connection appears as `Processing`, you can accept and configure it in AWS:

   1. Accept the peering request coming from {CLOUD_LONG}. The request can take up to 5 min to arrive. Within 5 more minutes after accepting, the peering should appear as `Connected` in {CONSOLE}.

   1. Configure at least the following in your AWS account networking:

      - Your subnet route table to route traffic to your Transit Gateway for the Peering VPC CIDRs.
      - Your Transit Gateway route table to route traffic to the newly created Transit Gateway peering attachment for the Peering VPC CIDRs.
      - Security groups to allow outbound TCP 5432.

1. **Attach a {CLOUD_LONG} service to the Peering VPC In [{CONSOLE}][console-services]**

   1. Select the {SERVICE_SHORT} you want to connect to the Peering VPC.
   1. Click `Operations` > `Security` > `VPC`.
   1. Select the VPC, then click `Attach VPC`.

   You cannot attach a {SERVICE_LONG} to multiple {CLOUD_LONG} {VPC}s at the same time.
