import { TIMESCALE_DB, PG } from '/snippets/vars.mdx';
import IntegrationPrereqs from '/snippets/integrations/_integration-prereqs-cloud-only.mdx';

## Prerequisites

<IntegrationPrereqs />

*   Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).
*   Install the Node.js package manager [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started).

## Connect to {TIMESCALE_DB}

In this section, you create a connection to {TIMESCALE_DB} with a common Node.js
ORM (object relational mapper) called [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org).

1.  At the command prompt, initialize a new Node.js app:

    ```bash
    npm init -y
    ```

    This creates a `package.json` file in your directory, which contains all
    of the dependencies for your project. It looks something like this:

    ```json
    {
      "name": "node-sample",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "description": "",
      "main": "index.js",
      "scripts": {
        "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
      },
      "keywords": [],
      "author": "",
      "license": "ISC"
    }
    ```

2.  Install Express.js:

    ```bash
    npm install express
    ```

3.  Create a simple web page to check the connection. Create a new file called
    `index.js`, with this content:

    ```javascript
    const express = require('express')
    const app = express()
    const port = 3000;

    app.use(express.json());
    app.get('/', (req, res) => res.send('Hello World!'))
    app.listen(port, () => console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${port}`))
    ```

4.  Test your connection by starting the application:

    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```

   In your web browser, navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. If the connection
   is successful, it shows "Hello World!"

5.  Add Sequelize to your project:

    ```bash
    npm install sequelize sequelize-cli pg pg-hstore
    ```

6.  Locate your {TIMESCALE_DB} credentials and use them to compose a connection
   string for Sequelize.

    You'll need:

      *   password
      *   username
      *   host URL
      *   port
      *   database name

7.  Compose your connection string variable, using this format:

    ```javascript
    'postgres://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<dbname>'
    ```

8.  Open the `index.js` file you created. Require Sequelize in the application,
    and declare the connection string:

    ```javascript
    const Sequelize = require('sequelize')
    const sequelize = new Sequelize('postgres://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<dbname>',
        {
            dialect: 'postgres',
            protocol: 'postgres',
            dialectOptions: {
                ssl: {
                    require: true,
                    rejectUnauthorized: false
                }
            }
        })
    ```

    Make sure you add the SSL settings in the `dialectOptions` sections. You
    can't connect to {TIMESCALE_DB} using SSL without them.

9.  You can test the connection by adding these lines to `index.js` after the
    `app.get` statement:

    ```javascript
    sequelize.authenticate().then(() => {
        console.log('Connection has been established successfully.');
    }).catch(err => {
        console.error('Unable to connect to the database:', err);
    });
    ```

    Start the application on the command line:

    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```

    If the connection is successful, you'll get output like this:

    ```bash
    Example app listening at http://localhost:3000
    Executing (default): SELECT 1+1 AS result
    Connection has been established successfully.
    ```

## Create a relational table

In this section, you create a relational table called `page_loads`.

1.  Use the Sequelize command line tool to create a table and model called `page_loads`:

    ```bash
    npx sequelize model:generate --name page_loads \
    --attributes userAgent:string,time:date
    ```

    The output looks similar to this:

    ```bash
    Sequelize CLI [Node: 12.16.2, CLI: 5.5.1, ORM: 5.21.11]

    New model was created at <PATH>.
    New migration was created at <PATH>.
    ```

2.  Edit the migration file so that it sets up a migration key:

    ```javascript
    'use strict';
    module.exports = {
      up: async (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {
        await queryInterface.createTable('page_loads', {
          userAgent: {
            primaryKey: true,
            type: Sequelize.STRING
          },
          time: {
            primaryKey: true,
            type: Sequelize.DATE
          }
        });
      },
      down: async (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {
        await queryInterface.dropTable('page_loads');
      }
    };
    ```

3.  Migrate the change and make sure that it is reflected in the database:

    ```bash
    npx sequelize db:migrate
    ```

    The output looks similar to this:

    ```bash
    Sequelize CLI [Node: 12.16.2, CLI: 5.5.1, ORM: 5.21.11]

    Loaded configuration file "config/config.json".
    Using environment "development".
    == 20200528195725-create-page-loads: migrating =======
    == 20200528195725-create-page-loads: migrated (0.443s)
    ```

4.  Create the `PageLoads` model in your code. In the `index.js` file, above the
    `app.use` statement, add these lines:

    ```javascript
    let PageLoads = sequelize.define('page_loads', {
        userAgent: {type: Sequelize.STRING, primaryKey: true },
        time: {type: Sequelize.DATE, primaryKey: true }
    }, { timestamps: false });
    ```

5.  Instantiate a `PageLoads` object and save it to the database.

## Create a hypertable

When you have created the relational table, you can create a hypertable.
Creating tables and indexes, altering tables, inserting data, selecting data,
and most other tasks are executed on the hypertable.

1.  Create a migration to modify the `page_loads` relational table, and change
    it to a hypertable by first running the following command:

    ```bash
    npx sequelize migration:generate --name add_hypertable
    ```

    The output looks similar to this:

    ```bash
    Sequelize CLI [Node: 12.16.2, CLI: 5.5.1, ORM: 5.21.11]

    migrations folder at <PATH> already exists.
    New migration was created at <PATH>/20200601202912-add_hypertable.js .
    ```

2.  In the `migrations` folder, there is now a new file. Open the
    file, and add this content:

    ```javascript
    'use strict';

    module.exports = {
      up: (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {
        return queryInterface.sequelize.query("SELECT create_hypertable('page_loads', by_range('time'));");
      },

      down: (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {
      }
    };
    ```

	<Note>
	The `by_range` dimension builder is an addition to {TIMESCALE_DB} 2.13.
	</Note>

3.  At the command prompt, run the migration command:

    ```bash
    npx sequelize db:migrate
    ```

    The output looks similar to this:

    ```bash
    Sequelize CLI [Node: 12.16.2, CLI: 5.5.1, ORM: 5.21.11]

    Loaded configuration file "config/config.json".
    Using environment "development".
    == 20200601202912-add_hypertable: migrating =======
    == 20200601202912-add_hypertable: migrated (0.426s)
    ```

## Insert rows of data

This section covers how to insert data into your hypertables.

1.  In the `index.js` file, modify the `/` route to get the `user-agent` from
    the request object (`req`) and the current timestamp. Then, call the
    `create` method on `PageLoads` model, supplying the user agent and timestamp
    parameters. The `create` call executes an `INSERT` on the database:

    ```javascript
    app.get('/', async (req, res) => {
        // get the user agent and current time
        const userAgent = req.get('user-agent');
        const time = new Date().getTime();

        try {
            // insert the record
            await PageLoads.create({
                userAgent, time
            });

            // send response
            res.send('Inserted!');
        } catch (e) {
            console.log('Error inserting data', e)
        }
    })
    ```

## Execute a query

This section covers how to execute queries against your database. In this
example, every time the page is reloaded, all information currently in the table
is displayed.

1.  Modify the `/` route in the `index.js` file to call the Sequelize `findAll`
    function and retrieve all data from the `page_loads` table using the
    `PageLoads` model:

    ```javascript
    app.get('/', async (req, res) => {
        // get the user agent and current time
        const userAgent = req.get('user-agent');
        const time = new Date().getTime();

        try {
            // insert the record
            await PageLoads.create({
                userAgent, time
            });

            // now display everything in the table
            const messages = await PageLoads.findAll();
            res.send(messages);
        } catch (e) {
            console.log('Error inserting data', e)
        }
    })
    ```

Now, when you reload the page, you should see all of the rows currently in the
`page_loads` table.
