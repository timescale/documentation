## Prerequisites

<IntegrationPrereqs />

*   Install the `psycopg2` library.

   For more information, see the [psycopg2 documentation](https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2/).
*   Create a [Python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). (Optional)

## Connect to TimescaleDB

In this section, you create a connection to {TIMESCALE_DB} using the `psycopg2`
library. This library is one of the most popular {PG} libraries for
Python. It allows you to execute raw SQL queries efficiently and safely, and
prevents common attacks such as SQL injection.

1.  Import the psycogpg2 library:

    ```python
    import psycopg2
    ```

2.  Locate your {TIMESCALE_DB} credentials and use them to compose a connection
   string for `psycopg2`.

    You'll need:

      *   password
      *   username
      *   host URL
      *   port
      *   database name

3.  Compose your connection string variable as a
    [libpq connection string](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING), using this format:

    ```python
    CONNECTION = "postgres://username:password@host:port/dbname"
    ```

    If you're using a hosted version of {TIMESCALE_DB}, or generally require an SSL
    connection, use this version instead:

    ```python
    CONNECTION = "postgres://username:password@host:port/dbname?sslmode=require"
    ```

    Alternatively you can specify each parameter in the connection string as follows

    ```python
    CONNECTION = "dbname=tsdb user=tsdbadmin password=secret host=host.com port=5432 sslmode=require"
    ```

    <Warning>
    This method of composing a connection string is for test or development
    purposes only. For production, use environment variables for sensitive
    details like your password, hostname, and port number.
    </Warning>

4.  Use the `psycopg2` [connect function](https://www.psycopg.org/docs/module.html?highlight=connect#psycopg2.connect) to create a new
    database session and create a new [cursor object](https://www.psycopg.org/docs/connection.html?highlight=cursor#connection.cursor) to
    interact with the database.

    In your `main` function, add these lines:

    ```python
    CONNECTION = "postgres://username:password@host:port/dbname"
    with psycopg2.connect(CONNECTION) as conn:
        cursor = conn.cursor()
        # use the cursor to interact with your database
        # cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM table")
    ```

    Alternatively, you can create a connection object and pass the object
    around as needed, like opening a cursor to perform database operations:

    ```python
    CONNECTION = "postgres://username:password@host:port/dbname"
    conn = psycopg2.connect(CONNECTION)
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    # use the cursor to interact with your database
    cursor.execute("SELECT 'hello world'")
    print(cursor.fetchone())
    ```

## Create a relational table

In this section, you create a table called `sensors` which holds the ID, type,
and location of your fictional sensors. Additionally, you create a hypertable
called `sensor_data` which holds the measurements of those sensors. The
measurements contain the time, sensor_id, temperature reading, and CPU
percentage of the sensors.

1.  Compose a string which contains the SQL statement to create a relational
    table. This example creates a table called `sensors`, with columns `id`,
    `type` and `location`:

    ```python
    query_create_sensors_table = """CREATE TABLE sensors (
                                        id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
                                        type VARCHAR(50),
                                        location VARCHAR(50)
                                    );
                                    """
    ```

2.  Open a cursor, execute the query you created in the previous step, and
    commit the query to make the changes persistent. Afterward, close the cursor
    to clean up:

    ```python
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    # see definition in Step 1
    cursor.execute(query_create_sensors_table)
    conn.commit()
    cursor.close()
    ```

## Create a hypertable

When you have created the relational table, you can create a hypertable.
Creating tables and indexes, altering tables, inserting data, selecting data,
and most other tasks are executed on the hypertable.

1.  Create a string variable that contains the `CREATE TABLE` SQL statement for
    your hypertable. Notice how the hypertable has the compulsory time column:

    ```python
    # create sensor data hypertable
    query_create_sensordata_table = """CREATE TABLE sensor_data (
                                            time TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
                                            sensor_id INTEGER,
                                            temperature DOUBLE PRECISION,
                                            cpu DOUBLE PRECISION,
                                            FOREIGN KEY (sensor_id) REFERENCES sensors (id)
                                        );
                                        """
    ```

2.  Formulate a `SELECT` statement that converts the `sensor_data` table to a
    hypertable. You must specify the table name to convert to a hypertable, and
    the name of the time column as the two arguments. For more information, see
    the [`create_hypertable` docs](/api/hypertable/create_hypertable):

    ```python
    query_create_sensordata_hypertable = "SELECT create_hypertable('sensor_data', by_range('time'));"
    ```

	<Note>
	The `by_range` dimension builder is an addition to {TIMESCALE_DB} 2.13.
	</Note>

3.  Open a cursor with the connection, execute the statements from the previous
    steps, commit your changes, and close the cursor:

    ```python
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute(query_create_sensordata_table)
    cursor.execute(query_create_sensordata_hypertable)
    # commit changes to the database to make changes persistent
    conn.commit()
    cursor.close()
    ```

## Insert rows of data

You can insert data into your hypertables in several different ways. In this
section, you can use `psycopg2` with prepared statements, or you can use
`pgcopy` for a faster insert.

1.  This example inserts a list of tuples, or relational data, called `sensors`,
    into the relational table named `sensors`. Open a cursor with a connection
    to the database, use prepared statements to formulate the `INSERT` SQL
    statement, and then execute that statement:

    ```python
    sensors = [('a', 'floor'), ('a', 'ceiling'), ('b', 'floor'), ('b', 'ceiling')]
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    for sensor in sensors:
      try:
        cursor.execute("INSERT INTO sensors (type, location) VALUES (%s, %s);",
                    (sensor[0], sensor[1]))
      except (Exception, psycopg2.Error) as error:
        print(error.pgerror)
    conn.commit()
    ```

2.  (Optional) Alternatively, you can pass variables to the `cursor.execute`
    function and separate the formulation of the SQL statement, `SQL`, from the
    data being passed with it into the prepared statement, `data`:

    ```python
    SQL = "INSERT INTO sensors (type, location) VALUES (%s, %s);"
    sensors = [('a', 'floor'), ('a', 'ceiling'), ('b', 'floor'), ('b', 'ceiling')]
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    for sensor in sensors:
      try:
        data = (sensor[0], sensor[1])
        cursor.execute(SQL, data)
      except (Exception, psycopg2.Error) as error:
        print(error.pgerror)
    conn.commit()
    ```

If you choose to use `pgcopy` instead, install the `pgcopy` package
[using pip](https://pypi.org/project/pgcopy/), and then add this line to your list of
`import` statements:

```python
from pgcopy import CopyManager
```

1.  Generate some random sensor data using the `generate_series` function
    provided by {PG}. This example inserts a total of 480 rows of data (4
    readings, every 5 minutes, for 24 hours). In your application, this would be
    the query that saves your time-series data into the hypertable:

    ```python
    # for sensors with ids 1-4
    for id in range(1, 4, 1):
        data = (id,)
        # create random data
        simulate_query = """SELECT generate_series(now() - interval '24 hour', now(), interval '5 minute') AS time,
                                %s as sensor_id,
                                random()*100 AS temperature,
                                random() AS cpu;
                                """
        cursor.execute(simulate_query, data)
        values = cursor.fetchall()
    ```

2.  Define the column names of the table you want to insert data into. This
    example uses the `sensor_data` hypertable created earlier. This hypertable
    consists of columns named `time`, `sensor_id`, `temperature` and `cpu`. The
    column names are defined in a list of strings called `cols`:

    ```python
    cols = ['time', 'sensor_id', 'temperature', 'cpu']
    ```

3.  Create an instance of the `pgcopy` CopyManager, `mgr`, and pass the
    connection variable, hypertable name, and list of column names. Then use the
    `copy` function of the CopyManager to insert the data into the database
    quickly using `pgcopy`.

    ```python
    mgr = CopyManager(conn, 'sensor_data', cols)
    mgr.copy(values)
    ```

4.  Commit to persist changes:

    ```python
    conn.commit()
    ```

5.  (Optional) The full sample code to insert data into {TIMESCALE_DB} using
    `pgcopy`, using the example of sensor data from four sensors:

    ```python
    # insert using pgcopy
    def fast_insert(conn):
        cursor = conn.cursor()

        # for sensors with ids 1-4
        for id in range(1, 4, 1):
            data = (id,)
            # create random data
            simulate_query = """SELECT generate_series(now() - interval '24 hour', now(), interval '5 minute') AS time,
                                    %s as sensor_id,
                                    random()*100 AS temperature,
                                    random() AS cpu;
                                    """
            cursor.execute(simulate_query, data)
            values = cursor.fetchall()

            # column names of the table you're inserting into
            cols = ['time', 'sensor_id', 'temperature', 'cpu']

            # create copy manager with the target table and insert
            mgr = CopyManager(conn, 'sensor_data', cols)
            mgr.copy(values)

        # commit after all sensor data is inserted
        # could also commit after each sensor insert is done
        conn.commit()
    ```

6.  (Optional) You can also check if the insertion worked:

    ```python
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM sensor_data LIMIT 5;")
    print(cursor.fetchall())
    ```

## Execute a query

This section covers how to execute queries against your database.

The first procedure shows a simple `SELECT *` query. For more complex queries,
you can use prepared statements to ensure queries are executed safely against
the database.

For more information about properly using placeholders in `psycopg2`, see the
[basic module usage document](https://www.psycopg.org/docs/usage.html).
For more information about how to execute more complex queries in `psycopg2`,
see the [psycopg2 documentation](https://www.psycopg.org/docs/usage.html).

### Execute a query

1.  Define the SQL query you'd like to run on the database. This example is a
    simple `SELECT` statement querying each row from the previously created
    `sensor_data` table.

    ```python
    query = "SELECT * FROM sensor_data;"
    ```

2.  Open a cursor from the existing database connection, `conn`, and then execute
   the query you defined:

    ```python
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    query = "SELECT * FROM sensor_data;"
    cursor.execute(query)
    ```

3.  To access all resulting rows returned by your query, use one of `pyscopg2`'s
    [results retrieval methods](https://www.psycopg.org/docs/cursor.html),
    such as `fetchall()` or `fetchmany()`. This example prints the results of
    the query, row by row. Note that the result of `fetchall()` is a list of
    tuples, so you can handle them accordingly:

    ```python
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    query = "SELECT * FROM sensor_data;"
    cursor.execute(query)
    for row in cursor.fetchall():
        print(row)
    cursor.close()
    ```

4.  (Optional) If you want a list of dictionaries instead, you can define the
    cursor using [`DictCursor`](https://www.psycopg.org/docs/extras.html#dictionary-like-cursor):

    ```python
    cursor = conn.cursor(cursor_factory=psycopg2.extras.DictCursor)
    ```

    Using this cursor, `cursor.fetchall()` returns a list of dictionary-like objects.

For more complex queries, you can use prepared statements to ensure queries are
executed safely against the database.

### Execute queries using prepared statements

1.  Write the query using prepared statements:

    ```python
    # query with placeholders
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    query = """
               SELECT time_bucket('5 minutes', time) AS five_min, avg(cpu)
               FROM sensor_data
               JOIN sensors ON sensors.id = sensor_data.sensor_id
               WHERE sensors.location = %s AND sensors.type = %s
               GROUP BY five_min
               ORDER BY five_min DESC;
               """
    location = "floor"
    sensor_type = "a"
    data = (location, sensor_type)
    cursor.execute(query, data)
    results = cursor.fetchall()
    ```
