Get a high-level overview of all vectorizers in the system.

- Regularly monitor and check the health of the entire system
- Display key information about each vectorizer's configuration and current state
- Use the `pending_items` column to get a quick indication of processing backlogs

## Samples

### Retrieve all vectorizers with pending items

```sql
SELECT * FROM ai.vectorizer_status WHERE pending_items > 0;
```

### System health monitoring

Alert if any vectorizer has more than 1000 pending items.

```sql
SELECT id, source_table, pending_items
FROM ai.vectorizer_status
WHERE pending_items > 1000;
```

### Get overview of all vectorizers

```sql
SELECT * FROM ai.vectorizer_status;
```

Sample output:

| id | source_table | target_table | view | pending_items |
|----|--------------|--------------|------|---------------|
| 1 | public.blog | public.blog_contents_embedding_store | public.blog_contents_embeddings | 1 |

## Returns

| Column name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| id | The unique identifier of this vectorizer |
| source_table | The fully qualified name of the source table |
| target_table | The fully qualified name of the table storing the embeddings |
| view | The fully qualified name of the view joining source and target tables |
| pending_items | The number of items waiting to be processed by the vectorizer |

The `pending_items` column indicates the number of items still awaiting embedding creation. The pending items count helps you to:
- Identify bottlenecks in processing
- Determine if you need to adjust scheduling or processing configurations
- Monitor the impact of large data imports or updates on your vectorizers
