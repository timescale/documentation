Calculate the instantaneous rate of change at the right, or latest, edge of a counter aggregate. This is equal to the last value minus the second-last value, divided by the time lapse between the two points, after accounting for resets. This calculation is useful for fast-moving counters.

## Arguments

| Name | Type | Default | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `summary` | `CounterSummary` | - | ✔ | A counter aggregate created using [`counter_agg`](#counter_agg) |


## Returns

`DOUBLE PRECISION`: The instantaneous rate of change at the right, or latest, edge of the counter aggregate

## Samples

Get the instantaneous rate of change at the end of each 15-minute counter aggregate.

```sql
SELECT
    id,
    bucket,
    irate_right(summary)
FROM (
    SELECT
        id,
        time_bucket('15 min'::interval, ts) AS bucket,
        counter_agg(ts, val) AS summary
    FROM foo
    GROUP BY id, time_bucket('15 min'::interval, ts)
) t
```
