Calculate the time when the counter value is predicted to have been zero. This is the x-intercept of the linear fit
between counter value and time.


## Samples

Estimate the time when the counter started

```sql
SELECT
    id,
    bucket,
    counter_zero_time(summary)
FROM (
    SELECT
        id,
        time_bucket('15 min'::interval, ts) AS bucket,
        counter_agg(ts, val) AS summary
    FROM foo
    GROUP BY id, time_bucket('15 min'::interval, ts)
) t
```
## Arguments

The syntax is:

```sql
counter_zero_time(
    summary CounterSummary
) RETURNS TIMESTAMPTZ
```
| Name | Type | Default | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `summary` | `CounterSummary` | - | ✔ | A counter aggregate created using [`counter_agg`](#counter_agg) |


## Returns

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| counter_zero_time | TIMESTAMPTZ | The time when the counter value is predicted to have been zero |
