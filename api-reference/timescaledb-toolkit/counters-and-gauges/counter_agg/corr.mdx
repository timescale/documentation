<Icon icon="circle-play" iconType="duotone" /> Since 1.3.0

Calculate the correlation coefficient from a counter aggregate. The calculation uses a linear least-squares fit, and returns a value between 0.0 and 1.0, from no correlation to the strongest possible correlation.

## Arguments

| Name | Type | Default | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `summary` | `CounterSummary` | - | ✔ | A counter aggregate created using [`counter_agg`](#counter_agg) |


## Returns

`DOUBLE PRECISION`: The correlation coefficient calculated with time as the independent variable and counter value as the dependent variable.

## Samples

Calculate the correlation coefficient to determine the goodness of a linear fit between counter value and time.

```sql
SELECT
    id,
    bucket,
    corr(summary)
FROM (
    SELECT
        id,
        time_bucket('15 min'::interval, ts) AS bucket,
        counter_agg(ts, val) AS summary
    FROM foo
    GROUP BY id, time_bucket('15 min'::interval, ts)
) t
```
