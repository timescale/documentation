<Icon icon="circle-play" iconType="duotone" /> Since 1.3.0

Calculate the y-intercept of a linear least-squares fit between counter value and time. This corresponds to the projected value at the Postgres epoch `(2000-01-01 00:00:00+00)`. You can use the y-intercept with the slope to plot a best-fit line.

## Arguments

| Name | Type | Default | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `summary` | `CounterSummary` | - | ✔ | A counter aggregate created using [`counter_agg`](#counter_agg) |


## Returns

`DOUBLE PRECISION`: The y-intercept of the linear least-squares fit

## Samples

Calculate the y-intercept of the linear fit for each 15-minute counter aggregate.

```sql
SELECT
    id,
    bucket,
    intercept(summary)
FROM (
    SELECT
        id,
        time_bucket('15 min'::interval, ts) AS bucket,
        counter_agg(ts, val) AS summary
    FROM foo
    GROUP BY id, time_bucket('15 min'::interval, ts)
) t
```
