<Icon icon="circle-play" iconType="duotone" /> Since 1.3.0

Get the change in a counter over a time period. This is the simple delta, computed by subtracting the last seen value
from the first, after accounting for resets.

## Arguments

| Name | Type | Default | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `summary` | `CounterSummary` | - | ✔ | A counter aggregated created using [`counter_agg`](#counter_agg) |


## Returns

`DOUBLE PRECISION`: The change in the counter over the bucketed interval

## Samples

Get the change in each counter over the entire time interval in table `foo`.

```sql
SELECT
    id,
    delta(summary)
FROM (
    SELECT
        id,
        counter_agg(ts, val) AS summary
    FROM foo
    GROUP BY id
) t
```
