Add time bounds to an already-computed gauge aggregate. Bounds are necessary to use extrapolation accessors on the aggregate.

## Arguments

| Name | Type | Default | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `cs` | `GaugeSummary` | - | ✔ | A gauge aggregate created using [`gauge_agg`](#gauge_agg) |
| `bounds` | `TSTZRANGE` | - | ✔ | A range of `timestamptz` giving the smallest and largest allowed times in the gauge aggregate |

## Returns

`GaugeSummary`: A new gauge aggregate with the bounds applied

## Samples

Create a gauge aggregate for each `id` and each 15-minute interval. Then add bounds to the gauge aggregate, so you can calculate the extrapolated rate.

```sql
SELECT
    id,
    bucket,
    extrapolated_rate(
        with_bounds(
            summary,
            time_bucket_range('15 min'::interval, bucket)
        )
    )
FROM (
    SELECT
        id,
        time_bucket('15 min'::interval, ts) AS bucket,
        gauge_agg(ts, val) AS summary
    FROM foo
    GROUP BY id, time_bucket('15 min'::interval, ts)
) t
```
