Calculate the time when the gauge value is modeled to have been zero. This is the x-intercept of the linear fit between
gauge value and time.

## Samples

Estimate the time when the gauge started

```sql
SELECT
    id,
    bucket,
    gauge_zero_time(summary)
FROM (
    SELECT
        id,
        time_bucket('15 min'::interval, ts) AS bucket,
        gauge_agg(ts, val) AS summary
    FROM foo
    GROUP BY id, time_bucket('15 min'::interval, ts)
) t
```
## Arguments

| Name | Type | Default | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `summary` | `GaugeSummary` | - | ✔ | A gauge aggregate created using [`gauge_agg`](#gauge_agg) |


## Returns

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| gauge_zero_time | TIMESTAMPTZ | The time when the gauge value is predicted to have been zero |
