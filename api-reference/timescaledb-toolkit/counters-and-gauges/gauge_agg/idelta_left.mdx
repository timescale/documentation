Calculate the instantaneous change at the left, or earliest, edge of a gauge aggregate. This is equal to the second
value minus the first value.

## Samples

Get the instantaneous change at the start of each 15-minute gauge aggregate.

```sql
SELECT
    id,
    bucket,
    idelta_left(summary)
FROM (
    SELECT
        id,
        time_bucket('15 min'::interval, ts) AS bucket,
        gauge_agg(ts, val) AS summary
    FROM foo
    GROUP BY id, time_bucket('15 min'::interval, ts)
) t
```
## Arguments

| Name | Type | Default | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `summary` | `GaugeSummary` | - | ✔ | A gauge aggregate created using [`gauge_agg`](#gauge_agg) |


## Returns

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| idelta_left | DOUBLE PRECISION | The instantaneous delta at the left, or earliest, edge of the counter aggregate |
