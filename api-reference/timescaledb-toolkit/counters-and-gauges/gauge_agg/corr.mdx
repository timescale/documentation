Calculate the correlation coefficient from a gauge aggregate. The calculation uses a linear least-squares fit, and
returns a value between 0.0 and 1.0, from no correlation to the strongest possible correlation.

## Samples

Calculate the correlation coefficient to determine the goodness of a linear fit between gauge value and time.

```sql
SELECT
    id,
    bucket,
    corr(summary)
FROM (
    SELECT
        id,
        time_bucket('15 min'::interval, ts) AS bucket,
        gauge_agg(ts, val) AS summary
    FROM foo
    GROUP BY id, time_bucket('15 min'::interval, ts)
) t
```
## Arguments

| Name | Type | Default | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `summary` | `GaugeSummary` | - | ✔ | A gauge aggregate created using [`gauge_agg`](#gauge_agg) |


## Returns

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| corr | DOUBLE PRECISION | The correlation coefficient calculated with time as the independent variable and counter value as the dependent variable. |
