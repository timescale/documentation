Get the change in a gauge over a time period. This is the simple delta, computed by subtracting the last seen value from
the first.

## Arguments

| Name | Type | Default | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `summary` | `GaugeSummary` | - | ✔ | A gauge aggregated created using [`gauge_agg`](#gauge_agg) |


## Returns

`DOUBLE PRECISION`: The change in the gauge over the bucketed interval

## Samples

Get the change in each gauge over the entire time interval in table `foo`.

```sql
SELECT
    id,
    delta(summary)
FROM (
    SELECT
        id,
        gauge_agg(ts, val) AS summary
    FROM foo
    GROUP BY id
) t
```
