Calculate the y-intercept of a linear least-squares fit between gauge value and time. This corresponds to the projected
value at the Postgres epoch `(2000-01-01 00:00:00+00)`. You can use the y-intercept with the slope to plot a best-fit
line.


## Samples

Calculate the y-intercept of the linear fit for each 15-minute gauge aggregate.

```sql
SELECT
    id,
    bucket,
    intercept(summary)
FROM (
    SELECT
        id,
        time_bucket('15 min'::interval, ts) AS bucket,
        gauge_agg(ts, val) AS summary
    FROM foo
    GROUP BY id, time_bucket('15 min'::interval, ts)
) t
```
## Arguments

The syntax is:

```sql
intercept(
    summary CounterSummary
) RETURNS DOUBLE PRECISION
```
| Name | Type | Default | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `summary` | `GaugeSummary` | - | ✔ | A gauge aggregate created using [`gauge_agg`](#gauge_agg) |


## Returns

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| intercept | DOUBLE PRECISION | The y-intercept of the linear least-squares fit |
