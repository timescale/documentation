Calculate the rate of change of the gauge. This is the simple rate, equal to the last value minus the first value,
divided by the time elapsed.

## Samples

Get the rate of change per `id` over the entire recorded interval.

```sql
SELECT
    id,
    rate(summary)
FROM (
    SELECT
        id,
        gauge_agg(ts, val) AS summary
    FROM foo
    GROUP BY id
) t
```
## Arguments

| Name | Type | Default | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `summary` | `GaugeSummary` | - | ✔ | A gauge aggregate created using [`gauge_agg`](#gauge_agg) |


## Returns

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| rate | DOUBLE PRECISION | The rate of change of the counter |
