Calculate the rate of change of a gauge during the time period specified by the bounds
in the gauge aggregate. The bounds must be specified for the `extrapolated_rate`
function to work. You can provide them as part of the original [`gauge_agg`](#gauge_agg)
call, or by using the [`with_bounds`](#with_bounds) function on an existing
gauge aggregate.

## Arguments

| Name | Type | Default | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `summary` | `GaugeSummary` | - | ✔ | A gauge aggregate created using [`gauge_agg`](#gauge_agg) |
| `method` | `TEXT` | - | ✔ | The extrapolation method to use. Not case-sensitive. The only allowed value is `prometheus`, for the Prometheus extrapolation protocol. |


## Returns

`DOUBLE PRECISION`: The extrapolated rate of change of the gauge over the timer period of the gauge aggregate.

## Samples

```sql
SELECT
    id,
    bucket,
    extrapolated_rate(
        with_bounds(
            summary,
            toolkit_experimental.time_bucket_range('15 min'::interval, bucket)
        ),'prometheus'
    )
FROM (
    SELECT
        id,
        time_bucket('15 min'::interval, ts) AS bucket,
        gauge_agg(ts, val) AS summary
    FROM foo
    GROUP BY id, time_bucket('15 min'::interval, ts)
) t;
```
