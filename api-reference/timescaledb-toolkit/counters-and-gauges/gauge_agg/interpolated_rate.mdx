Calculate the rate of change in a gauge over a time period. Data points at the exact boundaries of the time period
aren't needed. The function interpolates the gauge values at the boundaries from adjacent gauge aggregates if needed.


## Samples

Calculate the per-second rate of change for each 15-minute interval, using interpolation to get the values at the
interval boundaries if they don't exist in the data.

```sql
SELECT
    id,
    bucket,
    interpolated_rate(
        summary,
        bucket,
        '15 min',
        LAG(summary) OVER (PARTITION BY id ORDER by bucket),
        LEAD(summary) OVER (PARTITION BY id ORDER by bucket)
    )
FROM (
    SELECT
        id,
        time_bucket('15 min'::interval, ts) AS bucket,
        gauge_agg(ts, val) AS summary
    FROM foo
    GROUP BY id, time_bucket('15 min'::interval, ts)
) t
```
## Arguments

The syntax is:

```sql
interpolated_rate(
    summary CounterSummary,
    start TIMESTAMPTZ,
    interval INTERVAL
    [, prev CounterSummary]
    [, next CounterSummary]
) RETURNS DOUBLE PRECISION
```
| Name | Type | Default | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `summary` | `GaugeSummary` | - | ✔ | A gauge aggregate created using [`gauge_agg`](#gauge_agg) |
| `start` | `TIMESTAMPTZ` | - | ✔ | The start of the time period to compute the rate over |
| `interval` | `INTERVAL` | - | ✔ | The length of the time period to compute the rate over |
| `prev` | `GaugeSummary` | - |  | The gauge aggregate from the previous interval, used to interpolate the value at `start`. If `NULL`, the first timestamp in `summary` is used as the start of the interval. |
| `next` | `GaugeSummary` | - |  | The gauge aggregate from the next interval, used to interpolate the value at `start + interval`. If `NULL`, the last timestamp in `summary` is used as the end of the interval. |


## Returns

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| interpolated_rate | DOUBLE PRECISION | The per-second rate of change of the counter between the specified bounds. If exact values are missing in the raw data for the first and last points, these values are interpolated linearly from the neighboring counter aggregates. |
