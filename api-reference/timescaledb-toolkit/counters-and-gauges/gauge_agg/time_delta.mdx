Get the number of seconds between the first and last measurements in a gauge aggregate

## Arguments

| Name | Type | Default | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `summary` | `GaugeSummary` | - | ✔ | A gauge aggregate created using [`gauge_agg`](#gauge_agg) |


## Returns

`DOUBLE PRECISION`: The difference, in seconds, between the first and last times

## Samples

Get the time difference between the first and last gauge readings for each 15-minute interval. Note this difference
isn't necessarily equal to `15 minutes * 60 seconds / minute`, because the first and last readings might not fall
exactly on the interval boundaries.

```sql
SELECT
    id,
    bucket,
    time_delta(summary)
FROM (
    SELECT
        id,
        time_bucket('15 min'::interval, ts) AS bucket,
        gauge_agg(ts, val) AS summary
    FROM foo
    GROUP BY id, time_bucket('15 min'::interval, ts)
) t
```
