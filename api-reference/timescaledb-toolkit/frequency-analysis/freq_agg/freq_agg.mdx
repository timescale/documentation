Aggregate data into a space-saving aggregate object, which stores frequency information in an intermediate form. You can
then use any of the accessors in this group to return estimated frequencies or the most common elements.

## Samples

Create a space-saving aggregate over a field `ZIP` in a `HomeSales` table. This aggregate tracks any `ZIP` value that
occurs in at least 5% of rows:

```sql
SELECT toolkit_experimental.freq_agg(0.05, ZIP) FROM HomeSales;
```

## Arguments

The syntax is:

```sql
freq_agg(
  min_freq DOUBLE PRECISION,
  value AnyElement
) RETURNS SpaceSavingAggregate
```
| Name | Type | Default | Required | Description |
|------|------|---------|----------|-------------|
| `min_freq` | DOUBLE PRECISION | - | ✔ | Frequency cutoff for keeping track of a value. Values that occur less frequently than the cutoff are not stored. |
| `value` | AnyElement | - | ✔ | The column to store frequencies for |

## Returns

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| agg | SpaceSavingAggregate | An object storing the most common elements of the given table and their estimated frequency. You can pass this object to any of the accessor functions to get a final result. |
