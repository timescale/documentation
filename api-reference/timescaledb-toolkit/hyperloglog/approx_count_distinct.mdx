This is an alternate first step for approximating the number of distinct
values. It provides some added convenience by using some sensible default
parameters to create a `hyperloglog`.

Use `approx_count_distinct` to create an intermediate aggregate from your raw data.
This intermediate form can then be used by one or more accessors in this
group to compute final results.

Optionally, multiple such intermediate aggregate objects can be combined
using [`rollup()`](#rollup) before an accessor is applied.

## Samples

Given a table called `samples`, with a column called `weights`, return
a `hyperloglog` over the `weights` column:

```sql
SELECT toolkit_experimental.approx_count_distinct(weights) FROM samples;
```

Using the same data, build a view from the aggregate that you can pass
to other `hyperloglog` functions.

```sql
CREATE VIEW hll AS SELECT toolkit_experimental.approx_count_distinct(data) FROM samples;
```

## Arguments

| Name | Type | Default | Required | Description |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| `value` | AnyElement | - | ✔ | The column containing the elements to count. The type must have an extended, 64-bit, hash function. |

## Returns

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| hyperloglog | Hyperloglog | A `hyperloglog` object which can be passed to other hyperloglog APIs for rollups and final calculation |
