For large datasets and datasets with high cardinality (many distinct values), this can be much more efficient in
both CPU and memory than an exact count using `count(DISTINCT)`.

The estimation uses the [`hyperloglog++`][hyperloglog-wiki] algorithm. If you aren't
sure what parameters to set for the `hyperloglog`, try using the
[`approx_count_distinct`][approx_count_distinct] aggregate, which sets some
reasonable default values.

This function group uses the [two-step aggregation][two-step-aggregation]
pattern. In addition to the usual aggregate function,
[`hyperloglog`][hyperloglog], it also includes the alternate aggregate function
[`approx_count_distinct`][approx_count_distinct]. Both produce a hyperloglog aggregate, which can then be used with the accessor and rollup functions in
this group.

## Samples

### Roll up two hyperloglogs

Roll up two hyperloglogs. The first hyperloglog buckets the integers from 1 to
100,000, and the second hyperloglog buckets the integers from 50,000 to
150,000. Accounting for overlap, the exact number of distinct values in the
combined set is 150,000.

Calling `distinct_count` on the rolled-up hyperloglog yields a final value of
150,552, so the approximation is off by only 0.368%:

```sql
SELECT distinct_count(rollup(logs))
FROM (
    (SELECT hyperloglog(4096, v::text) logs FROM generate_series(1, 100000) v)
    UNION ALL
    (SELECT hyperloglog(4096, v::text) FROM generate_series(50000, 150000) v)
) hll;
```

Output:

```sql
 distinct_count
----------------
         150552
```

## Approximate relative errors

These are the approximate errors for each bucket size:

| precision | registers (bucket size) |  error |  column size (in bytes) |
