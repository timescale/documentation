import TwoStepAggregation from '/snippets/api-reference/timescaledb/hyperfunctions/two-step-aggregation.mdx';

Perform analysis of financial asset data. These specialized hyperfunctions make
it easier to write financial analysis queries that involve candlestick data.

They help you answer questions such as:

*   What are the opening and closing prices of these stocks?
*   When did the highest price occur for this stock?

This function group uses the [two-step aggregation][two-step-aggregation]
pattern. In addition to the usual aggregate function,
[`candlestick_agg`][candlestick_agg], it also includes the pseudo-aggregate
function [`candlestick`][candlestick]. `candlestick_agg` produces a candlestick aggregate from
raw tick data, which can then be used with the accessor and rollup functions in
this group. `candlestick` takes pre-aggregated data and transforms it into the
same format that `candlestick_agg` produces. This allows you to use the
accessors and rollups with existing candlestick data.

## Two-step aggregation

## Samples

### Get candlestick values from tick data

Query your tick data table for the opening, high, low, and closing prices, and
the trading volume, for each 1 hour period in the last day:

``` sql
SELECT
    time_bucket('1 hour'::interval, "time") AS ts,
    symbol,
    open(candlestick_agg("time", price, volume)),
    high(candlestick_agg("time", price, volume)),
    low(candlestick_agg("time", price, volume)),
    close(candlestick_agg("time", price, volume)),
    volume(candlestick_agg("time", price, volume))
FROM crypto_ticks
WHERE "time" > now() - '1 day'::interval
GROUP BY ts, symbol
;

-- or

WITH cs AS (
    SELECT time_bucket('1 hour'::interval, "time") AS hourly_bucket,
      symbol,
      candlestick_agg("time", price, volume) AS candlestick
    FROM crypto_ticks
    WHERE "time" > now() - '1 day'::interval
    GROUP BY hourly_bucket, symbol
)
SELECT hourly_bucket,
  symbol,
  open(candlestick),
  high(candlestick),
  low(candlestick),
  close(candlestick),
  volume(candlestick)
FROM cs
;
```

### Create a continuous aggregate from tick data and roll it up

Create a continuous aggregate on your stock trade data:

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW candlestick
WITH (timescaledb.continuous) AS
SELECT time_bucket('1 minute'::interval, "time") AS ts,
  symbol,
  candlestick_agg("time", price, volume) AS candlestick
FROM crypto_ticks
GROUP BY ts, symbol
;
```

Query your by-minute continuous aggregate over stock trade data for the opening,
high, low, and closing (OHLC) prices, along with their timestamps, in the last
hour:

``` sql
SELECT ts,
  symbol,
    open_time(candlestick),
    open(candlestick),
    high_time(candlestick),
    high(candlestick),
    low_time(candlestick),
    low(candlestick),
    close_time(candlestick),
    close(candlestick)
FROM candlestick
WHERE ts > now() - '1 hour'::interval
;
```

Roll up your by-minute continuous aggregate into daily buckets and return the
Volume Weighted Average Price for `AAPL` for the last month:

``` sql
SELECT
    time_bucket('1 day'::interval, ts) AS daily_bucket,
    symbol,
    vwap(rollup(candlestick))
FROM candlestick
WHERE symbol = 'AAPL'
      AND ts > now() - '1 month'::interval
GROUP BY daily_bucket
ORDER BY daily_bucket
;
```

Roll up your by-minute continuous aggregate into hourly buckets and return the
the opening, high, low, and closing prices and the volume for each 1 hour period
in the last day:

``` sql
SELECT
    time_bucket('1 hour'::interval, ts) AS hourly_bucket,
    symbol,
    open(rollup(candlestick)),
    high(rollup(candlestick)),
    low(rollup(candlestick)),
    close(rollup(candlestick)),
    volume(rollup(candlestick))
FROM candlestick
WHERE ts > now() - '1 day'::interval
GROUP BY hourly_bucket
;
```

### Starting from already-aggregated data

If you have a table of pre-aggregated stock data, it might look similar this
this format:

``` sql
           ts           │ symbol │  open  │  high  │  low   │ close  │  volume

You can use the [`candlestick`](#candlestick) function to transform the data
into a form that you'll be able pass to all of the accessors and
[`rollup`](#rollup) functions. To show that your data is preserved, this example
shows how these accessors return a table that looks just like your data:

``` sql
SELECT
    ts,
    symbol,
    open(candlestick),
    high(candlestick),
    low(candlestick),
    close(candlestick),
    volume(candlestick)
FROM (
    SELECT
        ts,
        symbol,
        candlestick(ts, open, high, low, close, volume)
    FROM historical_data
) AS _(ts, symbol, candlestick);
;

-- or

WITH cs AS (
    SELECT ts
      symbol,
      candlestick(ts, open, high, low, close, volume)
    FROM historical_data
)
SELECT
    ts
    symbol,
    open(candlestick),
    high(candlestick),
    low(candlestick),
    close(candlestick),
    volume(candlestick)
FROM cs
;
```

The advantage of transforming your data into the candlestick aggergate form is
that you can then use other functions in this group, such as [`rollup`](#rollup)
and [`vwap`](#vwap).

Roll up your by-day historical data into weekly buckets and return the Volume
Weighted Average Price:

``` sql
SELECT
    time_bucket('1 week'::interval, ts) AS weekly_bucket,
    symbol,
    vwap(rollup(candlestick))
FROM (
    SELECT
        ts,
        symbol,
        candlestick(ts, open, high, low, close, volume)
    FROM historical_data
) AS _(ts, symbol, candlestick)
GROUP BY weekly_bucket, symbol
;
```
