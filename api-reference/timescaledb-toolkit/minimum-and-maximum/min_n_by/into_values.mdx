<Icon icon="circle-play" iconType="duotone" /> Since 1.16.0

This returns the smallest values seen by the aggregate and the
corresponding values associated with them. Note that Postgres requires
an input argument with type matching the associated value in order to
determine the response type.

## Samples

Find the bottom 5 values from `i * 13 % 10007` for i = 1 to 10000, and
the integer result of the operation that generated that modulus.

```sql
SELECT into_values(
    min_n_by(sub.mod, sub.div, 5),
    NULL::INT)
FROM (
  SELECT (i * 13) % 10007 AS mod, (i * 13) / 10007 AS div
  FROM generate_series(1,10000) as i
) sub;
```

Output:

```sql
into_values
-------------
(1,9)
(2,5)
(3,1)
(4,10)
(5,6)
```

## Arguments

| Name | Type | Default | Required | Description |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| `agg` | MinNBy | - | ✔ | The aggregate to return the results from. Note that the exact type here varies based on the type of data stored. |
| `dummy` | ANYELEMENT | - | ✔ | This is purely to inform Postgres of the response type. A NULL cast to the appropriate type is typical. |

## Returns

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| into_values | SETOF BIGINT \| SETOF DOUBLE PRECISION \| SETOF TIMESTAMPTZ | The lowest values seen while creating this aggregate. |
