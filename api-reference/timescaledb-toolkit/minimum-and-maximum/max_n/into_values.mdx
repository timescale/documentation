Return the N highest values seen by the aggregate.

## Samples

Get the 5 highest daily temperatures from a weather dataset:

## Arguments

The syntax is:

```sql
SELECT into_values(
    max_n(temperature, 5)
) FROM weather_data
WHERE date = '2024-01-15';
```

This returns a set of values that you can use in a query. For example:

```sql
-- Get the top 5 temperatures for each location
SELECT
    location,
    into_values(max_n(temperature, 5)) as top_temp
FROM weather_data
GROUP BY location;
```

Output:
```
location  | top_temp
----------|----------
Station_A | 32.5
Station_A | 31.2
Station_A | 30.8
Station_A | 29.5
Station_A | 28.9
Station_B | 28.3
Station_B | 27.8
...
```

To aggregate the results into daily buckets and get the highest values:

```sql
WITH daily_max AS (
    SELECT
        time_bucket('1 day'::interval, ts) as day,
        max_n(temperature, 3) AS top_temps
    FROM weather_data
    GROUP BY day
)
SELECT
    day,
    into_values(top_temps) as temperature
FROM daily_max
ORDER BY day, temperature DESC;
```
```sql
into_values (
    agg MaxN
) SETOF BIGINT | SETOF DOUBLE PRECISION | SETOF TIMESTAMPTZ
```

| Name | Type | Default | Required | Description |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| `agg` | MaxN | - | ✔ | The aggregate to return the results from. Note that the exact type here varies based on the type of data stored. |

## Returns

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| into_values | SETOF BIGINT \| SETOF DOUBLE PRECISION \| SETOF TIMESTAMPTZ | The lowest values seen while creating this aggregate. |
