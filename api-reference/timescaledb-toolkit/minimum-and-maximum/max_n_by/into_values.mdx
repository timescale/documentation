<Icon icon="circle-play" iconType="duotone" /> Since 1.16.0

This returns the largest values seen by the aggregate and the
corresponding values associated with them. Note that Postgres requires
an input argument with type matching the associated value in order to
determine the response type.

## Arguments

| Name | Type | Default | Required | Description |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| `agg` | MaxNBy | - | ✔ | The aggregate to return the results from. Note that the exact type here varies based on the type of data stored. |
| `dummy` | ANYELEMENT | - | ✔ | This is purely to inform Postgres of the response type. A NULL cast to the appropriate type is typical. |

## Returns

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| into_values | SETOF BIGINT \| SETOF DOUBLE PRECISION \| SETOF TIMESTAMPTZ | The lowest values seen while creating this aggregate. |
