import TwoStepAggregation from '/snippets/api-reference/timescaledb/hyperfunctions/two-step-aggregation.mdx';

Get the N largest values from a column, with an associated piece of data per
value. For example, you can return an accompanying column, or the full row.

The `max_n_by()` functions give the same results as the regular SQL query
`SELECT ... ORDER BY ... LIMIT n`. But unlike the SQL query, they can be
composed and combined like other aggregate hyperfunctions.

To get the N smallest values with accompanying data, use
[`min_n_by()`][min_n_by]. To get the N largest values without accompanying data,
use [`max_n()`][max_n].

This function group uses the [two-step aggregation][two-step-aggregation]
pattern. In addition to the usual aggregate function [`max_n_by`][max_n_by], it also
includes accessors and rollup functions.

## Two-step aggregation

## Samples

This example assumes that you have a table of stock trades in this format:

```sql
CREATE TABLE stock_sales(
    ts TIMESTAMPTZ,
    symbol TEXT,
    price FLOAT,
    volume INT
);
```

Find the 10 largest transactions in the table, what time they occurred, and what
symbol was being traded:

```sql
SELECT
    (data).ts,
    (data).symbol,
    value AS transaction
FROM
    into_values((
        SELECT max_n_by(price * volume, stock_sales, 10)
        FROM stock_sales
    ),
    NULL::stock_sales);
```

## Available functions

### Aggregate
- [`max_n_by()`][max_n_by]: construct an aggregate that keeps track of the largest values and associated data

### Accessors
- [`into_values()`][into_values]: return the N highest values with their associated data

### Rollup
- [`rollup()`][rollup]: combine multiple MaxNBy aggregates
