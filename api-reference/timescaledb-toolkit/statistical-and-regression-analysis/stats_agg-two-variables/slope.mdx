Calculate the slope of the linear fitting line from a two-dimensional statistical aggregate. The calculation uses the
standard least-squares fitting for linear regression.

```sql
slope(
    summary StatsSummary2D
) RETURNS DOUBLE PRECISION
```

## Samples

Calculate the slope from independent variable `y` and dependent variable `x` for each 15-minute time bucket:

```sql
SELECT
    id,
    time_bucket('15 min'::interval, ts) AS bucket,
    slope(stats_agg(y, x)) AS summary
FROM foo
GROUP BY id, time_bucket('15 min'::interval, ts)
```## Arguments

| Name | Type | Default | Required | Description |
|------|------|---------|----------|-------------|
| summary | StatsSummary2D | - | ✔ | The statistical aggregate produced by a `stats_agg` call |

## Returns

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| slope | DOUBLE PRECISION | The slope of the least-squares fit line |
