Combine multiple intermediate two-dimensional statistical aggregate (`StatsSummary2D`) objects into a single
`StatsSummary2D` object. For example, you can use `rollup` to combine statistical aggregates from 15-minute buckets into
daily buckets.

For use in window function, see `rolling()`.

```sql
rolling(
    ss StatsSummary2D
) RETURNS StatsSummary2D
```
