Calculate the correlation coefficient from a two-dimensional statistical aggregate. The calculation uses the standard
least-squares fitting for linear regression.

## Samples

Calculate the correlation coefficient of independent variable `y` and dependent variable `x` for each 15-minute time
bucket:

```sql
SELECT
  id,
  time_bucket('15 min'::interval, ts) AS bucket,
  corr(stats_agg(y, x)) AS summary
FROM foo
GROUP BY id, time_bucket('15 min'::interval, ts)
```

## Arguments

The syntax is:

```sql
corr(
  summary StatsSummary2D
) RETURNS DOUBLE PRECISION
```
| Name | Type | Default | Required | Description |
|------|------|---------|----------|-------------|
| summary | StatsSummary2D | - | ✔ | The statistical aggregate produced by a `stats_agg` call |

## Returns

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| corr | DOUBLE PRECISION | The correlation coefficient of the least-squares fit line |
