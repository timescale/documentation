Calculate the covariance from a two-dimensional statistical aggregate. The calculation uses the standard least-squares
fitting for linear regression.

```sql
covariance(
    summary StatsSummary2D,
    [ method TEXT ]
) RETURNS DOUBLE PRECISION
```

## Arguments

| Name | Type | Default | Required | Description |
|------|------|---------|----------|-------------|
| summary | StatsSummary2D | - | ✔ | The statistical aggregate produced by a `stats_agg` call |
| method | TEXT | `sample` | - | The method used for calculating the covariance. The two options are `population` and `sample`, which can be abbreviated to `pop` or `samp` |

## Returns

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| covariance | DOUBLE PRECISION | The covariance of the least-squares fit line |

## Samples

Calculate the covariance of independent variable `y` and dependent variable `x` for each 15-minute time bucket:

```sql
SELECT
    id,
    time_bucket('15 min'::interval, ts) AS bucket,
    covariance(stats_agg(y, x)) AS summary
FROM foo
GROUP BY id, time_bucket('15 min'::interval, ts)
```
