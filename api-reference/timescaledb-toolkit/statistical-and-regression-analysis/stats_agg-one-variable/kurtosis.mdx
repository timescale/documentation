Calculate the kurtosis from the values in a statistical aggregate. The kurtosis is the fourth statistical moment. It is
a measure of "tailedness" of a data distribution compared to a normal distribution.

```sql
kurtosis(
  summary StatsSummary1D,
  [ method TEXT ]
) DOUBLE PRECISION
```

## Arguments

| Name | Type | Default | Required | Description |
|------|------|---------|----------|-------------|
| summary | StatsSummary1D | - | ✔ | The statistical aggregate produced by a `stats_agg` call |
| method | TEXT | `sample` | - | The method used for calculating the kurtosis. The two options are `population` and `sample`, which can be abbreviated to `pop` or `samp` |

## Returns

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| kurtosis | DOUBLE PRECISION | The kurtosis of the values in the statistical aggregate |

## Samples

Calculate the kurtosis of a sample containing the integers from 0 to 100:

```sql
SELECT kurtosis(stats_agg(data))
  FROM generate_series(0, 100) data;
```

```sql
kurtosis
