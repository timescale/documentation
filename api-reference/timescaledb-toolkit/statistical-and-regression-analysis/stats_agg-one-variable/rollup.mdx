Combine multiple intermediate statistical aggregate (`StatsSummary1D`) objects produced by `stats_agg` (one variable)
into a single intermediate `StatsSummary1D` object. For example, you can use `rollup` to combine statistical aggregates
from 15-minute buckets into daily buckets.

For use in window functions, see `rolling()`.

## Arguments

The syntax is:

```sql
rollup(
    ss StatsSummary1D
) RETURNS StatsSummary1D
```
| Name | Type | Default | Required | Description |
|------|------|---------|----------|-------------|
| summary | StatsSummary1D | - | ✔ | The statistical aggregate produced by a `stats_agg` call |

## Returns

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| rollup | StatsSummary1D | A new statistical aggregate produced by combining the input statistical aggregates |
