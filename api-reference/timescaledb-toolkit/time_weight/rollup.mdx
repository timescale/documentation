Combine multiple intermediate time-weighted aggregate (TimeWeightSummary) objects produced by time_weight() into a
single intermediate TimeWeightSummary object. For example, you can use `rollup` to combine time-weighted aggregates from
15-minute buckets into daily buckets.


## Arguments

The syntax is:

```sql
rollup(
    tws TimeWeightSummary
) RETURNS TimeWeightSummary
```
| Name | Type | Default | Required | Description |
|------|------|---------|----------|-------------|
| time_weight | TimeWeightSummary | - | ✔ | The TimeWeightSummary aggregate produced by a time_weight call |

## Returns

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| rollup | TimeWeightSummary | A new TimeWeightSummary aggregate produced by combining the input TimeWeightSummary aggregates |
