Combine multiple state aggregates into a single state aggregate. For example, you can use `rollup` to combine state
aggregates from 15-minute buckets into daily buckets.

```sql
rollup(
    agg StateAgg
) RETURNS StateAgg
```

## Samples

Combine multiple state aggregates and calculate the duration spent in the `START` state.

```sql
WITH buckets AS (SELECT
    time_bucket('1 minute', ts) as dt,
    toolkit_experimental.compact_state_agg(ts, state) AS sa
FROM states_test
GROUP BY time_bucket('1 minute', ts))
SELECT toolkit_experimental.duration_in(
    'START',
    toolkit_experimental.rollup(buckets.sa)
)
FROM buckets;
```## Arguments

| Name | Type | Default | Required | Description |
|------|------|---------|----------|-------------|
| agg | StateAgg | - | ✔ | State aggregates created using `compact_state_agg` |

## Returns

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| agg | StateAgg | A new state aggregate that combines the input state aggregates |
