List the periods when the system is in a specific state from a state aggregate. Periods are defined by the start time
and end time.

Unlike [`state_periods`][state_periods], you can use this function across multiple state aggregates that cover different
time buckets. Any missing values at the time bucket boundaries are interpolated from adjacent state aggregates.

## Samples

Given state aggregates bucketed by 1-minute intervals, interpolate the states at the bucket boundaries and list all time
periods corresponding to the state `OK`.

To perform the interpolation, the `LAG` and `LEAD` functions are used to get the previous and next state aggregates.

```sql
SELECT
    bucket,
    (interpolated_state_periods(
        summary,
        'OK',
        bucket,
        '15 min',
        LAG(summary) OVER (ORDER by bucket)
    )).*
FROM (
    SELECT
        time_bucket('1 min'::interval, ts) AS bucket,
        state_agg(ts, state) AS summary
    FROM states_test
    GROUP BY time_bucket('1 min'::interval, ts)
) t;
```

Returns:

```
         bucket         |       start_time       |        end_time

## Arguments

The syntax is:

```sql
interpolated_state_periods(
  agg StateAgg,
  state [TEXT | BIGINT],
  start TIMESTAMPTZ,
  interval INTERVAL,
  [, prev StateAgg]
) RETURNS (TIMESTAMPTZ, TIMESTAMPTZ)
```
| Name | Type | Default | Required | Description |
|------|------|---------|----------|-------------|
| agg | StateAgg | - | ✔ | A state aggregate created with [`state_agg`][state_agg] |
| state | TEXT \| BIGINT | - | ✔ | The state to query |
| start | TIMESTAMPTZ | - | ✔ | The start of the interval to be calculated |
| interval | INTERVAL | - | ✔ | The length of the interval to be calculated |
| prev | StateAgg | - | | The state aggregate from the prior interval, used to interpolate the value at `start`. If `NULL`, the first timestamp in `aggregate` is used as the start of the interval |

## Returns

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| start_time | TIMESTAMPTZ | The time when the state started (inclusive) |
| end_time | TIMESTAMPTZ | The time when the state ended (exclusive) |
