<Icon icon="circle-play" iconType="duotone" /> Since 1.15.0

Calculate the total duration in a given state. Unlike [`duration_in`][duration_in], you can use this function across multiple state aggregates that cover multiple time buckets. Any missing values at the time bucket boundaries are interpolated from adjacent state aggregates.

```sql
interpolated_duration_in(
  agg StateAgg,
  state {TEXT | BIGINT},
  start TIMESTAMPTZ,
  interval INTERVAL
  [, prev StateAgg]
) RETURNS DOUBLE PRECISION
```

## Arguments

| Name | Type | Default | Required | Description |
|------|------|---------|----------|-------------|
| agg | StateAgg | - | ✔ | A state aggregate created with [`state_agg`][state_agg] |
| state | TEXT \| BIGINT | - | ✔ | The state to query |
| start | TIMESTAMPTZ | - | ✔ | The start of the interval to be calculated |
| interval | INTERVAL | - | ✔ | The length of the interval to be calculated |
| prev | StateAgg | - | | The state aggregate from the prior interval, used to interpolate the value at `start`. If `NULL`, the first timestamp in `aggregate` is used as the start of the interval |

## Returns

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| interpolated_duration_in | INTERVAL | The total time spent in the queried state. Displayed as `days`, `hh:mm:ss`, or a combination of the two |

## Samples

Create a test table that tracks when a system switches between `starting`, `running`, and `error` states. Query the table for the time spent in the `running` state. Use `LAG` and `LEAD` to get the neighboring aggregates for interpolation.

If you prefer to see the result in seconds, [`EXTRACT`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-datetime.html#FUNCTIONS-DATETIME-EXTRACT) the epoch from the returned result.

```sql
SELECT
  time,
  interpolated_duration_in(
    agg,
    'running',
    time,
    '1 day',
    LAG(agg) OVER (ORDER BY time)
) FROM (
  SELECT
    time_bucket('1 day', time) as time,
    state_agg(time, state) as agg
  FROM
    states
  GROUP BY time_bucket('1 day', time)
) s;
```

Returns:

```
time                    | interpolated_duration_in
