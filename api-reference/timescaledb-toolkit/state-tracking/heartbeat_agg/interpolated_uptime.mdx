Calculate uptime from a heartbeat aggregate, taking the heartbeat aggregate from the preceding interval to interpolate
values at the boundary. This checks when the last heartbeat in the predecessor was received and makes sure that the
entire heartbeat interval after that is considered live. This addresses the issue where `uptime` would consider the
interval between the start of the interval and the first heartbeat as dead.

```sql
interpolated_uptime(
    agg HEARTBEATAGG,
    pred HEARTBEATAGG
) RETURNS INTERVAL
```

## Arguments

| Name | Type | Default | Required | Description |
|------|------|---------|----------|-------------|
| agg | HeartbeatAgg | - | ✔ | A heartbeat aggregate to get the liveness data from |
| pred | HeartbeatAgg | - | | The heartbeat aggregate for the interval before the one being measured, if one exists |

## Returns

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| interpolated_uptime | INTERVAL | The sum of all the live ranges in the aggregate, including those covered by the last heartbeat of the previous interval |

## Samples

Given a table called `liveness` containing weekly heartbeat aggregates in column `health` with timestamp column `date`,
use this command to get the total interpolated uptime of the system during the week of Jan 9, 2022.

```sql
SELECT interpolated_uptime(
  health,
  LAG(health) OVER (ORDER BY date)
)
FROM liveness
WHERE date = '01-9-2022 UTC'
```

Returns:

```
interpolated_uptime

  6 days 23:56:05
