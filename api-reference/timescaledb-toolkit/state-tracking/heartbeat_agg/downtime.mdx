<Icon icon="circle-play" iconType="duotone" /> Since 1.15.0

Sum all the ranges where the system did not have a recent enough heartbeat from a heartbeat aggregate.

There may appear to be some downtime between the start of the aggregate and the first heartbeat. If there is a heartbeat aggregate covering the previous period, you can use its last heartbeat to correct for this using [`interpolated_downtime()`][interpolated_downtime].

```sql
downtime(
    agg HEARTBEATAGG
) RETURNS INTERVAL
```

## Arguments

| Name | Type | Default | Required | Description |
|------|------|---------|----------|-------------|
| agg | HeartbeatAgg | - | ✔ | A heartbeat aggregate to get the liveness data from |

## Returns

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| downtime | INTERVAL | The sum of all the dead ranges in the aggregate |

## Samples

Given a table called `liveness` containing weekly heartbeat aggregates in column `health` with timestamp column `date`, use the following to get the total downtime of the system during the week of Jan 9, 2022.

```sql
SELECT downtime(health)
FROM liveness
WHERE date = '01-9-2022 UTC'
```

Returns:

```
downtime
--------
00:04:25
```
