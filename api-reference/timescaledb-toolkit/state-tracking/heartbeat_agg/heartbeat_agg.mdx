<Icon icon="circle-play" iconType="duotone" /> Since 1.15.0

Aggregate a set of heartbeat timestamps to track the liveness state of the underlying system for the specified time
range.

```sql
heartbeat_agg(
    heartbeat TIMESTAMPTZ,
    agg_start TIMESTAMPTZ,
    agg_duration INTERVAL,
    heartbeat_liveness INTERVAL
) RETURNS HeartbeatAgg
```

## Samples

Given a table called `system_health` with a `ping_time` column, construct an aggregate of system liveness for 10 days
starting from Jan 1, 2022. This assumes a system is unhealthy if it hasn't been heard from in a 5 minute window.

```sql
SELECT heartbeat_agg(
  ping_time,
  '01-01-2022 UTC',
  '10 days',
  '5 min')
FROM system_health;
```
## Arguments

| Name | Type | Default | Required | Description |
|------|------|---------|----------|-------------|
| heartbeat | TIMESTAMPTZ | - | ✔ | The column containing the timestamps of the heartbeats |
| agg_start | TIMESTAMPTZ | - | ✔ | The start of the time range over which this aggregate is tracking liveness |
| agg_duration | INTERVAL | - | ✔ | The length of the time range over which this aggregate is tracking liveness. Any point in this range that doesn't closely follow a heartbeat is considered to be dead |
| heartbeat_liveness | INTERVAL | - | ✔ | How long the system is considered to be live after each heartbeat |

## Returns

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| heartbeat_agg | HeartbeatAgg | The liveness data for the heartbeated system over the provided interval |
