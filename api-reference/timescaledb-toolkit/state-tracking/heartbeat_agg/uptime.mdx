<Icon icon="circle-play" iconType="duotone" /> Since 1.15.0

Sum all the ranges where the system was live and return the total from a heartbeat aggregate.

There may appear to be some downtime between the start of the aggregate and the first heartbeat. If there is a heartbeat
aggregate covering the previous period, you can use its last heartbeat to correct for this using
[`interpolated_uptime()`][interpolated_uptime].

## Samples

Given a table called `liveness` containing weekly heartbeat aggregates in column `health` with timestamp column `date`,
use this command to get the total uptime of the system during the week of Jan 9, 2022.

```sql
SELECT uptime(health)
FROM liveness
WHERE date = '01-9-2022 UTC'
```

Returns:

```
    uptime
-----------------
6 days 23:55:35
```

## Arguments

The syntax is:

```sql
uptime(
    agg HEARTBEATAGG
) RETURNS INTERVAL
```
| Name | Type | Default | Required | Description |
|------|------|---------|----------|-------------|

## Returns
