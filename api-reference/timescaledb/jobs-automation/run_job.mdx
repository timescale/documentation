Run a previously registered {JOB} in the current session.
This works for {JOB} as well as policies.
Since `run_job` is implemented as stored procedure it cannot be executed
inside a SELECT query but has to be executed with `CALL`.

<Info>

Any background worker {JOB} can be run in the foreground when executed with
`run_job`. You can use this with an increased log level to help debug problems.

</Info>

## Samples

Set log level shown to client to `DEBUG1` and run the {JOB} with the {JOB} ID 1000:

```sql
SET client_min_messages TO DEBUG1;
CALL run_job(1000);
```

## Arguments

The syntax is:

```sql
CALL run_job(
    job_id = <job_id>
);
```

| Name | Type | Default | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `job_id` | INTEGER | - | ✔ | TimescaleDB background {JOB} ID |
