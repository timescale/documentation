import { HYPERTABLE, HYPERTABLE_CAP, CHUNK, CHUNK_CAP, CAGG, PG } from '/snippets/vars.mdx';

Get the approximate total disk space used by a {HYPERTABLE} or {CAGG},
that is, the sum of the size for the table itself including {CHUNK}s,
any indexes on the table, and any toast tables. The size is reported
in bytes. This is equivalent to computing the sum of `total_bytes`
column from the output of `hypertable_approximate_detailed_size` function.

When a {CAGG} name is provided, the function
transparently looks up the backing {HYPERTABLE} and returns its statistics
instead.

<Note>
This function relies on the per backend caching using the in-built
{PG} storage manager layer to compute the approximate size
cheaply. The PG cache invalidation clears off the cached size for a
{CHUNK} when DML happens into it. That size cache is thus able to get
the latest size in a matter of minutes. Also, due to the backend
caching, any long running session will only fetch latest data for new
or modified {CHUNK}s and can use the cached data (which is calculated
afresh the first time around) effectively for older {CHUNK}s. Thus it
is recommended to use a single connected {PG} backend session to
compute the approximate sizes of {HYPERTABLE}s to get faster results.
</Note>

For more information about using {HYPERTABLE}s, including {CHUNK} size partitioning,
see the [hypertable section][hypertable-docs].

## Samples

Get the approximate size information for a {HYPERTABLE}.

```sql
SELECT * FROM hypertable_approximate_size('devices');
 hypertable_approximate_size
-----------------------------
                        8192
```

Get the approximate size information for all {HYPERTABLE}s.

```sql
SELECT hypertable_name, hypertable_approximate_size(format('%I.%I', hypertable_schema, hypertable_name)::regclass)
  FROM timescaledb_information.hypertables;
```

Get the approximate size information for a {CAGG}.

```sql
SELECT hypertable_approximate_size('device_stats_15m');

 hypertable_approximate_size
-----------------------------
                        8192
```

## Arguments

|Name|Type| Default | Required | Description|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|`hypertable`|REGCLASS| - | ✔ |Hypertable or continuous aggregate to show size of.|

## Returns

|Name|Type|Description|
|-|-|-|
|hypertable_approximate_size|BIGINT|Total approximate disk space used by the specified {HYPERTABLE}, including all indexes and TOAST data|

<Note>

`NULL` is returned if the function is executed on a non-{HYPERTABLE} relation.
