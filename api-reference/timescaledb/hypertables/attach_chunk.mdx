Attach a {HYPERTABLE} as a {CHUNK} in another {HYPERTABLE} at a given slice in a dimension.

![Hypertable structure](https://assets.timescale.com/docs/images/hypertable-structure.png)

The schema, name, existing constraints, and indexes of `chunk` do not change, even
if a constraint conflicts with a {CHUNK} constraint in `hypertable`.

The `hypertable` you attach `chunk` to does not need to have the same dimension columns as the
{HYPERTABLE} you previously [detached `chunk`][hypertable-detach-chunk] from.

While attaching `chunk` to `hypertable`:
- Dimension columns in `chunk` are set as `NOT NULL`.
- Any foreign keys in `hypertable` are created in `chunk`.

You cannot:
-  Attaching a {CHUNK} that is still attached to another {HYPERTABLE}. First call
  [detach_chunk][hypertable-detach-chunk].
- Attaching foreign tables are not supported.

## Samples

Attach a {HYPERTABLE} as a {CHUNK} in another {HYPERTABLE} for a specific slice in a dimension:

```sql
CALL attach_chunk('ht', '_timescaledb_internal._hyper_1_2_chunk', '{"device_id": [0, 1000]}');
```

## Arguments

The syntax is:

```sql
CALL attach_chunk(
    hypertable = '<hypertable_name>',
    chunk = '<chunk_name>',
    slices = '<jsonb_slices>'
);
```

| `hypertable` | REGCLASS | - | ✔ | Name of the {HYPERTABLE} to attach `chunk` to.                                                                                                  |
| `chunk` | REGCLASS | - | ✔ | Name of the {CHUNK} to attach.                                                                                                                  |
| `slices` | JSONB | - | ✔ | The slice `chunk` will occupy in `hypertable`. `slices` cannot clash with the slice already occupied by an existing {CHUNK} in `hypertable`. |
