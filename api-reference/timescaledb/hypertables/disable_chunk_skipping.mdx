import { HYPERTABLE, HYPERTABLE_CAP, CHUNK, CHUNK_CAP, COLUMNSTORE } from '/snippets/vars.mdx';

Disable range tracking for a specific column in a {HYPERTABLE} **in the {COLUMNSTORE}**.

## Samples

In this sample, you convert the `conditions` table to a {HYPERTABLE} with
partitioning on the `time` column. You then specify and enable additional
columns to track ranges for. You then disable range tracking:

```sql
SELECT create_hypertable('conditions', 'time');
SELECT enable_chunk_skipping('conditions', 'device_id');
SELECT disable_chunk_skipping('conditions', 'device_id');
```

<Note>

 Best practice is to enable range tracking on columns which are correlated to the
 partitioning column. In other words, enable tracking on secondary columns that are
 referenced in the `WHERE` clauses in your queries.
 Use this API to disable range tracking on columns when the query patterns don't
 use this secondary column anymore.

</Note>

## Arguments

The syntax is:

```sql
SELECT disable_chunk_skipping(
    hypertable = '<hypertable_name>',
    column_name = '<column_name>',
    if_not_exists = true | false
);
```

|Name|Type| Default | Required | Description|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|`hypertable`|REGCLASS| - | ✔ |Hypertable that the column belongs to|
|`column_name`|TEXT| - | ✔ |Column to disable tracking range statistics for|
|`if_not_exists`|BOOLEAN| `FALSE` | ✖ |Set to `true` so that a notice is sent when ranges are not being tracked for a column. By default, an error is thrown|

## Returns

|Column|Type|Description|
|-|-|-|
|`hypertable_id`|INTEGER|ID of the hypertable in TimescaleDB.|
|`column_name`|TEXT|Name of the column range tracking is disabled for|
|`disabled`|BOOLEAN|Returns `true` when tracking is disabled. `false` when `if_not_exists` is `true` and the entry was not removed|

<Note>

To `disable_chunk_skipping()`, you must have first called [enable_chunk_skipping][enable_chunk_skipping]
and enabled range tracking on a column in the hypertable.
