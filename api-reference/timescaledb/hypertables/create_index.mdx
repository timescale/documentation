import { HYPERTABLE, HYPERTABLE_CAP, CHUNK, CHUNK_CAP } from '/snippets/vars.mdx';

```SQL
CREATE INDEX ... WITH (timescaledb.transaction_per_chunk, ...);
```

This option extends [`CREATE INDEX`][postgres-createindex] with the ability to
use a separate transaction for each {CHUNK} it creates an index on, instead of
using a single transaction for the entire {HYPERTABLE}. This allows `INSERT`s, and
other operations to be performed concurrently during most of the duration of the
`CREATE INDEX` command. While the index is being created on an individual {CHUNK},
it functions as if a regular `CREATE INDEX` were called on that {CHUNK}, however
other {CHUNK}s are completely unblocked.

This version of `CREATE INDEX` can be used as an alternative to
`CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY`, which is not currently supported on {HYPERTABLE}s.

<Warning>

- Not supported for `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX`.
- If the operation fails partway through, indexes might not be created on all
{HYPERTABLE} {CHUNK}s. If this occurs, the index on the root table of the {HYPERTABLE}
is marked as invalid. You can check this by running `\d+` on the {HYPERTABLE}. The
index still works, and is created on new {CHUNK}s, but if you want to ensure all
{CHUNK}s have a copy of the index, drop and recreate it.

   You can also use the following query to find all invalid indexes:

   ```SQL
   SELECT * FROM pg_index i WHERE i.indisvalid IS FALSE;
   ```

</Warning>

## Samples

Create an anonymous index:

```SQL
CREATE INDEX ON conditions(time, device_id)
    WITH (timescaledb.transaction_per_chunk);
```

Alternatively:

```SQL
CREATE INDEX ON conditions USING brin(time, location)
    WITH (timescaledb.transaction_per_chunk);
```
