import { HYPERTABLE, HYPERTABLE_CAP, CHUNK, CHUNK_CAP, CAGG } from '/snippets/vars.mdx';

Sets the `chunk_time_interval` on a {HYPERTABLE}. The new interval is used
when new {CHUNK}s are created, and time intervals on existing {CHUNK}s are
not changed.

## Samples

For a TIMESTAMP column, set `chunk_time_interval` to 24 hours:

```sql
SELECT set_chunk_time_interval('conditions', INTERVAL '24 hours');
SELECT set_chunk_time_interval('conditions', 86400000000);
```

For a time column expressed as the number of milliseconds since the
UNIX epoch, set `chunk_time_interval` to 24 hours:

```sql
SELECT set_chunk_time_interval('conditions', 86400000);
```

## Arguments


| Name        | Type             | Default | Required                                                             | Description                                                                                                                                      |
|-------------|------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`hypertable`|REGCLASS| -       | ✔                                                                    | {HYPERTABLE} or {CAGG} to update interval for.                                                                                       |
|`chunk_time_interval`|See note|-       | ✔   | Event time that each new {CHUNK} covers.                                                                                                           |
|`dimension_name`|REGCLASS|-       | ✖ | The name of the time dimension to set the number of partitions for. Only use `dimension_name` when your {HYPERTABLE} has multiple time dimensions. |

If you change {CHUNK} time interval you may see a {CHUNK} that is smaller than the new interval. For example, if you
have two 7-day {CHUNK}s that cover 14 days, then change `chunk_time_interval` to 3 days, you may end up with a
transition {CHUNK} covering one day. This happens because the start and end of the new {CHUNK} is calculated based on
dividing the timeline by the `chunk_time_interval` starting at epoch 0. This leads to the following {CHUNK}s
[0, 3), [3, 6), [6, 9), [9, 12), [12, 15), [15, 18) and so on. The two 7-day {CHUNK}s covered data up to day 14:
[0, 7), [8, 14), so the 3-day {CHUNK} for [12, 15) is reduced to a one day {CHUNK}. The following {CHUNK} [15, 18) is
created as a full 3 day {CHUNK}.

The valid types for the `chunk_time_interval` depend on the type used for the
{HYPERTABLE} `time` column:

|`time` column type|`chunk_time_interval` type|Time unit|
|-|-|-|
|TIMESTAMP|INTERVAL|days, hours, minutes, etc|
||INTEGER or BIGINT|microseconds|
|TIMESTAMPTZ|INTERVAL|days, hours, minutes, etc|
||INTEGER or BIGINT|microseconds|
|DATE|INTERVAL|days, hours, minutes, etc|
||INTEGER or BIGINT|microseconds|
|SMALLINT|SMALLINT|The same time unit as the `time` column|
|INT|INT|The same time unit as the `time` column|
|BIGINT|BIGINT|The same time unit as the `time` column|
