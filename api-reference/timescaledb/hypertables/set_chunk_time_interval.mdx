Sets the `chunk_time_interval` on a hypertable. The new interval is used
when new chunks are created, and time intervals on existing chunks are
not changed.

## Samples

For a TIMESTAMP column, set `chunk_time_interval` to 24 hours:

```sql
SELECT set_chunk_time_interval('conditions', INTERVAL '24 hours');
SELECT set_chunk_time_interval('conditions', 86400000000);
```

For a time column expressed as the number of milliseconds since the
UNIX epoch, set `chunk_time_interval` to 24 hours:

```sql
SELECT set_chunk_time_interval('conditions', 86400000);
```

## Arguments


| Name        | Type             | Default | Required                                                             | Description                                                                                                                                      |
|-------------|------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`hypertable`|REGCLASS| -       | ✔                                                                    | Hypertable or continuous aggregate to update interval for.                                                                                       |
|`chunk_time_interval`|See note|-       | ✔   | Event time that each new chunk covers.                                                                                                           |
|`dimension_name`|REGCLASS|-       | ✖ | The name of the time dimension to set the number of partitions for. Only use `dimension_name` when your hypertable has multiple time dimensions. |

If you change chunk time interval you may see a chunk that is smaller than the new interval. For example, if you
have two 7-day chunks that cover 14 days, then change `chunk_time_interval` to 3 days, you may end up with a
transition chunk covering one day. This happens because the start and end of the new chunk is calculated based on
dividing the timeline by the `chunk_time_interval` starting at epoch 0. This leads to the following chunks
[0, 3), [3, 6), [6, 9), [9, 12), [12, 15), [15, 18) and so on. The two 7-day chunks covered data up to day 14:
[0, 7), [8, 14), so the 3-day chunk for [12, 15) is reduced to a one day chunk. The following chunk [15, 18) is
created as a full 3 day chunk.

The valid types for the `chunk_time_interval` depend on the type used for the
hypertable `time` column:

|`time` column type|`chunk_time_interval` type|Time unit|
|-|-|-|
|TIMESTAMP|INTERVAL|days, hours, minutes, etc|
||INTEGER or BIGINT|microseconds|
|TIMESTAMPTZ|INTERVAL|days, hours, minutes, etc|
||INTEGER or BIGINT|microseconds|
|DATE|INTERVAL|days, hours, minutes, etc|
||INTEGER or BIGINT|microseconds|
|SMALLINT|SMALLINT|The same time unit as the `time` column|
|INT|INT|The same time unit as the `time` column|
|BIGINT|BIGINT|The same time unit as the `time` column|
