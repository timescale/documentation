import { CHUNK, HYPERTABLE, HYPERTABLE_CAP, CAGG } from '/snippets/vars.mdx';

Get the list of {CHUNK}s associated with a {HYPERTABLE}.

Function accepts the following required and optional arguments. These arguments
have the same semantics as the `drop_chunks` [function][drop_chunks].

## Samples

- Get the list of all {CHUNK}s associated with a table:

    ```sql
    SELECT show_chunks('conditions');
    ```

- For {HYPERTABLE}s with mixed-case names, include double quotes within the string literal:

    ```sql
    SELECT show_chunks('"MyMixedCaseTable"');
    ```

- Or with schema qualification:

    ```sql
    SELECT show_chunks('public."MyMixedCaseTable"');
    ```

- Get all {CHUNK}s from the {HYPERTABLE} called `conditions` that are older than 3 months:

    ```sql
    SELECT show_chunks('conditions', older_than => INTERVAL '3 months');
    ```

- Get all {CHUNK}s from the {HYPERTABLE} called `conditions` created earlier than 3 months before:

    ```sql
    SELECT show_chunks('conditions', created_before => INTERVAL '3 months');
    ```

- Get all {CHUNK}s from the {HYPERTABLE} `conditions` created in the previous month:

    ```sql
    SELECT show_chunks('conditions', created_after => INTERVAL '1 month');
    ```

- Get all {CHUNK}s from the {HYPERTABLE} `conditions` created before 2017:

    ```sql
    SELECT show_chunks('conditions', older_than => DATE '2017-01-01');
    ```

## Arguments

| Name | Type | Default | Required | Description |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| `relation` | REGCLASS | - | ✔ | {HYPERTABLE_CAP} or {CAGG} from which to select {CHUNK}s. |
| `older_than` | ANY | - | ✖ | Specification of cut-off point where any {CHUNK}s older than this timestamp should be shown. |
| `newer_than` | ANY | - | ✖ | Specification of cut-off point where any {CHUNK}s newer than this timestamp should be shown. |
| `created_before` | ANY | - | ✖ | Specification of cut-off point where any {CHUNK}s created before this timestamp should be shown. |
| `created_after` | ANY | - | ✖ | Specification of cut-off point where any {CHUNK}s created after this timestamp should be shown. |

The `older_than` and `newer_than` parameters can be specified in two ways:

*   **interval type:** The cut-off point is computed as `now() -
    older_than` and similarly `now() - newer_than`. An error is returned if an
    INTERVAL is supplied and the time column is not one of a TIMESTAMP,
    TIMESTAMPTZ, or DATE.

*   **timestamp, date, or integer type:** The cut-off point is explicitly given
    as a TIMESTAMP / TIMESTAMPTZ / DATE or as a SMALLINT / INT / BIGINT. The
    choice of timestamp or integer must follow the type of the {HYPERTABLE}'s time
    column.

The `created_before` and `created_after` parameters can be specified in two ways:

*   **interval type:** The cut-off point is computed as `now() -
    created_before` and similarly `now() - created_after`.  This uses
    the {CHUNK} creation time for the filtering.

*   **timestamp, date, or integer type:** The cut-off point is
    explicitly given as a `TIMESTAMP` / `TIMESTAMPTZ` / `DATE` or as a
    `SMALLINT` / `INT` / `BIGINT`. The choice of integer value
    must follow the type of the {HYPERTABLE}'s partitioning column. Otherwise
    the {CHUNK} creation time is used for the filtering.

When both `older_than` and `newer_than` arguments are used, the
function returns the intersection of the resulting two ranges. For
example, specifying `newer_than => 4 months` and `older_than => 3
months` shows all {CHUNK}s between 3 and 4 months old.
Similarly, specifying `newer_than => '2017-01-01'` and `older_than
=> '2017-02-01'` shows all {CHUNK}s between '2017-01-01' and
'2017-02-01'. Specifying parameters that do not result in an
overlapping intersection between two ranges results in an error.

When both `created_before` and `created_after` arguments are used, the
function returns the intersection of the resulting two ranges. For
example, specifying `created_after => 4 months` and `created_before => 3
months` shows all {CHUNK}s created between 3 and 4 months from now.
Similarly, specifying `created_after => '2017-01-01'` and `created_before
=> '2017-02-01'` shows all {CHUNK}s created between '2017-01-01' and
'2017-02-01'. Specifying parameters that do not result in an
overlapping intersection between two ranges results in an error.

<Note>
The `created_before`/`created_after` parameters cannot be used together with
`older_than`/`newer_than`.
