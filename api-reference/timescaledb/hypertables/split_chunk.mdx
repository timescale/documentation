Split a large {CHUNK} at a specific point in time. If you do not specify the timestamp to split at, the {CHUNK}
is split equally.

## Samples

* Split a chunk at a specific time:

    ```sql
    CALL split_chunk('chunk_1', split_at => '2025-03-01 00:00');
    ```

* Split a {CHUNK} in two:

  For example, If the {CHUNK} duration is, 24 hours, the following command splits `chunk_1` into
  two {CHUNK}s of 12 hours each.
    ```sql
    CALL split_chunk('chunk_1');
    ```

## Arguments

The syntax is:

```sql
CALL split_chunk(
    chunk = '<chunk_name>',
    split_at = <split_point>
);
```
