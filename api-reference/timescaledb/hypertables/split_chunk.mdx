Split a large chunk at a specific point in time. If you do not specify the timestamp to split at, `chunk`
is split equally.

## Samples

* Split a chunk at a specific time:

    ```sql
    CALL split_chunk('chunk_1', split_at => '2025-03-01 00:00');
    ```

* Split a chunk in two:

  For example, If the chunk duration is, 24 hours, the following command splits `chunk_1` into
  two chunks of 12 hours each.
    ```sql
    CALL split_chunk('chunk_1');
    ```
