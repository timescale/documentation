TimescaleDB allows you to move data and indexes to different tablespaces. This
allows you to move data to more cost-effective storage as it ages.

The `move_chunk` function acts like a combination of the
[{PG} CLUSTER command][postgres-cluster] and
[{PG} ALTER TABLE...SET TABLESPACE][postgres-altertable] commands. Unlike
these {PG} commands, however, the `move_chunk` function uses lower lock
levels so that the chunk and hypertable are able to be read for most of the
process. This comes at a cost of slightly higher disk usage during the
operation. For a more detailed discussion of this capability, see the
documentation on [managing storage with tablespaces][manage-storage].

<Note>
You must be logged in as a super user, such as the `postgres` user,
to use the `move_chunk()` call.

## Samples

``` sql
SELECT move_chunk(
  chunk => '_timescaledb_internal._hyper_1_4_chunk',
  destination_tablespace => 'tablespace_2',
  index_destination_tablespace => 'tablespace_3',
  reorder_index => 'conditions_device_id_time_idx',
  verbose => TRUE
);
```
