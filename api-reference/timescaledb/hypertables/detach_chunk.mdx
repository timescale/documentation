Separate a chunk from a [hypertable][hypertables-section].

![Hypertable structure](https://assets.timescale.com/docs/images/hypertable-structure.png)

`chunk` becomes a standalone hypertable with the same name and schema. All existing constraints and
indexes on `chunk` are preserved after detaching. Foreign keys are dropped.

In this initial release, you cannot detach a chunk that has been [converted to the {COLUMNSTORE}][setup-hypercore].

## Samples

Detach a chunk from a hypertable:

```sql
CALL detach_chunk('_timescaledb_internal._hyper_1_2_chunk');
```


## Arguments

|Name|Type| Description                  |
|---|---|------------------------------|
| `chunk` | REGCLASS | Name of the chunk to detach. |


## Returns

This function returns void.
