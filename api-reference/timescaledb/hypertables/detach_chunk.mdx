Separate a {CHUNK} from a [{HYPERTABLE}][hypertables-section].

![Hypertable structure](https://assets.timescale.com/docs/images/hypertable-structure.png)

The {CHUNK} becomes a standalone {HYPERTABLE} with the same name and schema. All existing constraints and
indexes on the {CHUNK} are preserved after detaching. Foreign keys are dropped.

In this initial release, you cannot detach a {CHUNK} that has been [converted to the {COLUMNSTORE}][setup-hypercore].

## Samples

Detach a {CHUNK} from a {HYPERTABLE}:

```sql
CALL detach_chunk('_timescaledb_internal._hyper_1_2_chunk');
```


## Arguments

The syntax is:

```sql
CALL detach_chunk(
    chunk = '<chunk_name>'
);
```

|Name|Type| Description                  |
|---|---|------------------------------|
| `chunk` | REGCLASS | Name of the {CHUNK} to detach. |
