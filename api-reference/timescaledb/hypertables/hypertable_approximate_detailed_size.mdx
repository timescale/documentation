import { HYPERTABLE, HYPERTABLE_CAP, CHUNK, CHUNK_CAP, CAGG, PG } from '/snippets/vars.mdx';

Get detailed information about approximate disk space used by a {HYPERTABLE} or
{CAGG}, returning size information for the table
itself, any indexes on the table, any toast tables, and the total
size of all. All sizes are reported in bytes.

When a {CAGG} name is provided, the function
transparently looks up the backing {HYPERTABLE} and returns its approximate
size statistics instead.

<Note>
This function relies on the per backend caching using the in-built
{PG} storage manager layer to compute the approximate size
cheaply. The PG cache invalidation clears off the cached size for a
{CHUNK} when DML happens into it. That size cache is thus able to get
the latest size in a matter of minutes. Also, due to the backend
caching, any long running session will only fetch latest data for new
or modified {CHUNK}s and can use the cached data (which is calculated
afresh the first time around) effectively for older {CHUNK}s. Thus it
is recommended to use a single connected {PG} backend session to
compute the approximate sizes of {HYPERTABLE}s to get faster results.
</Note>

For more information about using {HYPERTABLE}s, including {CHUNK} size partitioning,
see the [hypertable section][hypertable-docs].

## Samples

Get the approximate size information for a {HYPERTABLE}.

```sql
SELECT * FROM hypertable_approximate_detailed_size('hyper_table');
 table_bytes | index_bytes | toast_bytes | total_bytes
-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------
        8192 |       24576 |       32768 |       65536
```

## Arguments

|Name|Type| Default | Required | Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `hypertable` | REGCLASS | - | ✔ | Hypertable or continuous aggregate to show detailed approximate size of. |

## Returns

|Column|Type|Description|
|-|-|-|
|table_bytes|BIGINT|Approximate disk space used by main_table (like `pg_relation_size(main_table)`)|
|index_bytes|BIGINT|Approximate disk space used by indexes|
|toast_bytes|BIGINT|Approximate disk space of toast tables|
|total_bytes|BIGINT|Approximate total disk space used by the specified table, including all indexes and TOAST data|

<Note>
If executed on a relation that is not a hypertable, the function
returns `NULL`.
