Merge two or more {CHUNK}s into one.

The partition boundaries for the new {CHUNK} is the union of all partitions of the merged {CHUNK}s.
The new {CHUNK} retains the name, constraints, and triggers of the _first_ {CHUNK} in the partition order.

You can only merge {CHUNK}s that have directly adjacent partitions. It is not possible to merge
{CHUNK}s that have another {CHUNK}, or an empty range between them in any of the partitioning
dimensions.

{CHUNK} merging has the following limitations. You cannot:

* Merge {CHUNK}s with tiered data
* Read or write from the {CHUNK}s while they are being merged

## Samples

- Merge two {CHUNK}s:

   ```sql
   CALL merge_chunks('_timescaledb_internal._hyper_1_1_chunk', '_timescaledb_internal._hyper_1_2_chunk');
   ```

- Merge more than two {CHUNK}s:

   ```sql
   CALL merge_chunks('{_timescaledb_internal._hyper_1_1_chunk, _timescaledb_internal._hyper_1_2_chunk, _timescaledb_internal._hyper_1_3_chunk}');
   ```


## Arguments

The syntax is:

```sql
CALL merge_chunks(
    chunk1 = '<chunk_name_1>',
    chunk2 = '<chunk_name_2>',
    concurrently = true | false
);

-- Or merge multiple chunks:
CALL merge_chunks(
    chunks = ARRAY['<chunk_name_1>', '<chunk_name_2>', ...]::REGCLASS[]
);
```

You can merge either two {CHUNK}s, or an arbitrary number of {CHUNK}s specified as an array of {CHUNK} identifiers.
When you call `merge_chunks`, you must specify either `chunk1` and `chunk2`, or `chunks`. You cannot use both
arguments.
