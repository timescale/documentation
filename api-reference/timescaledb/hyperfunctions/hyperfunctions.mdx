Hyperfunctions in {TIMESCALE_DB} are a specialized set of functions that allow you to
analyze time-series data. You can use hyperfunctions to analyze anything you
have stored as time-series data, including IoT devices, IT systems, marketing
analytics, user behavior, financial metrics, and cryptocurrency.

Some hyperfunctions are included by default in {TIMESCALE_DB}. For
additional hyperfunctions, you need to install the
[{TOOLKIT_LONG}][install-toolkit] {PG} extension.

For more information, see the [hyperfunctions
documentation][hyperfunctions-howto].
