The `time_bucket` function is similar to the standard {PG} `date_bin`
function. Unlike `date_bin`, it allows for arbitrary time intervals of months or
longer. The return value is the bucket's start time.

Buckets are aligned to start at midnight in UTC+0. The time bucket size (`bucket_width`) can be set as INTERVAL or INTEGER. For INTERVAL-type `bucket_width`, you can change the time zone with the optional `timezone` parameter. In this case, the buckets are realigned to start at midnight in the time zone you specify.

Note that during shifts to and from daylight savings, the amount of data
aggregated into the corresponding buckets can be irregular. For example, if the
`bucket_width` is 2 hours, the number of bucketed hours is either three hours or one hour.

## Samples

Simple five-minute averaging:

```sql
SELECT time_bucket('5 minutes', time) AS five_min, avg(cpu)
FROM metrics
GROUP BY five_min
ORDER BY five_min DESC LIMIT 10;
```

To report the middle of the bucket, instead of the left edge:

```sql
SELECT time_bucket('5 minutes', time) + '2.5 minutes'
  AS five_min, avg(cpu)
FROM metrics
GROUP BY five_min
ORDER BY five_min DESC LIMIT 10;
```

For rounding, move the alignment so that the middle of the bucket is at the
five-minute mark, and report the middle of the bucket:

```sql
SELECT time_bucket('5 minutes', time, '-2.5 minutes'::INTERVAL) + '2.5 minutes'
  AS five_min, avg(cpu)
FROM metrics
GROUP BY five_min
ORDER BY five_min DESC LIMIT 10;
```

In this example, add the explicit cast to ensure that {PG} chooses the
correct function.

To shift the alignment of the buckets, you can use the origin parameter passed as
a timestamp, timestamptz, or date type. This example shifts the start of the
week to a Sunday, instead of the default of Monday:

```sql
SELECT time_bucket('1 week', timetz, TIMESTAMPTZ '2017-12-31')
  AS one_week, avg(cpu)
FROM metrics
GROUP BY one_week
WHERE time > TIMESTAMPTZ '2017-12-01'  AND time < TIMESTAMPTZ '2018-01-03'
ORDER BY one_week DESC LIMIT 10;
```

The value of the origin parameter in this example is `2017-12-31`, a Sunday
within the period being analyzed. However, the origin provided to the function
can be before, during, or after the data being analyzed. All buckets are
calculated relative to this origin. So, in this example, any Sunday could have
been used. Note that because `time < TIMESTAMPTZ '2018-01-03'` is used in this
example, the last bucket would have only 4 days of data. This cast to TIMESTAMP
converts the time to local time according to the server's time zone setting.

```sql
SELECT time_bucket(INTERVAL '2 hours', timetz::TIMESTAMP)
  AS five_min, avg(cpu)
FROM metrics
GROUP BY five_min
ORDER BY five_min DESC LIMIT 10;
```

Bucket temperature values to calculate the average monthly temperature. Set the
time zone to 'Europe/Berlin' so bucket start and end times are aligned to
midnight in Berlin.

```sql
SELECT time_bucket('1 month', ts, 'Europe/Berlin') AS month_bucket,
  avg(temperature) AS avg_temp
FROM weather
GROUP BY month_bucket
ORDER BY month_bucket DESC LIMIT 10;
```

## Arguments

| Name | Type | Default | Required | Description |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| `bucket_width` | INTERVAL | - | ✔ | A {PG} time interval for how long each bucket is |
| `ts` | DATE, TIMESTAMP, or TIMESTAMPTZ | - | ✔ | The timestamp to bucket |
| `timezone` | TEXT | UTC+0 | ❌ | The time zone for calculating bucket start and end times. Can only be used with `TIMESTAMPTZ`. |
| `origin` | DATE, TIMESTAMP, or TIMESTAMPTZ | midnight on January 3, 2000 (for buckets < month) or midnight on January 1, 2000 (for month/year/century buckets) | ❌ | Buckets are aligned relative to this timestamp |
| `offset` | INTERVAL | - | ❌ | The time interval to offset all time buckets by. A positive value shifts bucket start and end times later. A negative value shifts bucket start and end times earlier. `offset` must be surrounded with double quotes when used as a named argument, because it is a reserved key word in {PG}. |

**For integer time inputs:**

| Name | Type | Default | Required | Description |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| `bucket_width` | INTEGER | - | ✔ | The bucket width |
| `ts` | INTEGER | - | ✔ | The timestamp to bucket |
| `offset` | INTEGER | - | ❌ | The amount to offset all buckets by. A positive value shifts bucket start and end times later. A negative value shifts bucket start and end times earlier. `offset` must be surrounded with double quotes when used as a named argument, because it is a reserved key word in {PG}. |

<Info>

If you use months as an interval for `bucket_width`, you cannot combine it with
a non-month component. For example, `1 month` and `3 months` are both valid
bucket widths, but `1 month 1 day` and `3 months 2 weeks` are not.
