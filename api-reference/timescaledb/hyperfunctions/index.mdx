import { TIMESCALE_DB, TOOLKIT_LONG, PG, HYPERFUNC } from '/snippets/vars.mdx';

For additional {HYPERFUNC}, use the [{TOOLKIT_LONG}][toolkit] {PG} extension.

## Samples

### Time bucketing with aggregates

Bucket temperature readings into 5-minute intervals and calculate statistics:

```sql
SELECT
  time_bucket('5 minutes', time) AS bucket,
  avg(temperature) AS avg_temp,
  first(temperature, time) AS first_temp,
  last(temperature, time) AS last_temp
FROM readings
GROUP BY bucket
ORDER BY bucket DESC;
```

### Gapfilling missing data

Fill gaps in time-series data using last observation carried forward (LOCF):

```sql
SELECT
  time_bucket_gapfill('1 hour', time) AS bucket,
  device_id,
  locf(avg(temperature)) AS filled_avg_temp
FROM readings
WHERE time >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day'
GROUP BY bucket, device_id
ORDER BY bucket DESC;
```

### Analyzing data distribution

Create a histogram of response times to understand distribution patterns:

```sql
SELECT histogram(response_time_ms, 0, 1000, 10)
FROM api_requests
WHERE time > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day';
```

### Approximate row counting

Get a fast estimate of table size without scanning all data:

```sql
SELECT approximate_row_count('readings');
```

## Available function groups

### Time series utilities
[Core functions for time bucketing, ordered selection, and time-based calculations][time-series-utilities]:
- [`time_bucket()`][time_bucket]: bucket rows by time interval
- [`time_bucket_ng()`][time_bucket_ng]: next generation time bucketing with additional features
- [`first()`][first]: get the first value ordered by another column
- [`last()`][last]: get the last value ordered by another column
- [`days_in_month()`][days_in_month]: calculate days in a month
- [`month_normalize()`][month_normalize]: normalize monthly metrics

### Gapfilling
[Functions for filling gaps in time-series data][gapfilling]:
- [`time_bucket_gapfill()`][time_bucket_gapfill]: bucket time and fill gaps in results
- [`locf()`][locf]: last observation carried forward for filling gaps
- [`interpolate()`][interpolate]: linear interpolation for filling gaps

### Distribution analysis
[Functions for analyzing data distribution patterns][distribution-analysis]:
- [`histogram()`][histogram]: create histograms to visualize data distribution
- [`approximate_row_count()`][approximate_row_count]: fast approximate count of rows in a table
