This is the first step for performing any statistical aggregate calculations
on one-dimensional data. Use `stats_agg` to create an intermediate aggregate
(`StatsSummary1D`) from your data. This intermediate form can then be used
by one or more accessors in this group to compute final results. Optionally,
multiple such intermediate aggregate objects can be combined using
[`rollup()`](#rollup) or [`rolling()`](#rolling) before an accessor is
applied.

`stats_agg` is well suited for creating a continuous aggregate that can
serve multiple purposes later. For example, you can create a continuous
aggregate using `stats_agg` to calculate average and sum. Later, you can
reuse the same `StatsSummary1D` objects to calculate standard deviation from
the same continuous aggregate.

## Arguments

| Name | Type | Default | Required | Description |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| `value` | DOUBLE PRECISION | - | ✔ | The variable to use for the statistical aggregate. |

## Returns

The statistical aggregate, containing data about the variables in an intermediate form. Pass the aggregate to accessor functions in the statistical aggregates API to perform final calculations. Or, pass the aggregate to rollup functions to combine multiple statistical aggregates into larger aggregates.
