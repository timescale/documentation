<Icon icon="circle-play" iconType="duotone" /> Since 1.15.0

Aggregate state data into a state aggregate to track state transitions.
Unlike [`compact_state_agg`](/api-reference/timescaledb/hyperfunctions/compact_state_agg),
which only stores durations, `state_agg` also stores the timestamps of
state transitions.

## Samples

Create a state aggregate to track the status of some devices.

```sql
SELECT state_agg(time, status) FROM devices;
```

## Arguments

| Name | Type | Default | Required | Description |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| `ts` | TIMESTAMPTZ | - | ✔ | Timestamps associated with each state reading |
| `value` | TEXT \| BIGINT | - | ✔ | The state at that time |

## Returns

An object storing the periods spent in each state, including timestamps of state transitions
