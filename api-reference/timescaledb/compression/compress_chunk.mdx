import { CHUNK, HYPERTABLE, TIMESCALE_DB } from '/snippets/vars.mdx';

Old API since [{TIMESCALE_DB} v2.18.0](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb/releases/tag/2.18.0). Replaced by [convert_to_columnstore()][convert-to-columnstore].

The `compress_chunk` function is used for synchronous compression (or recompression, if necessary) of a specific
{CHUNK}. This is most often used instead of the [`add_compression_policy`][add-compression-policy] function, when a user
wants more control over the scheduling of compression. For most users, we suggest using the policy framework instead.

You can also compress {CHUNK}s by [running the job associated with your compression policy][run-job]. `compress_chunk`
gives you more fine-grained control by allowing you to target a specific {CHUNK} that needs compressing.

<Tip>
You can get a list of {CHUNK}s belonging to a {HYPERTABLE} using the [`show_chunks` function][show-chunks].
</Tip>

## Samples

Compress a single {CHUNK}.

```sql
SELECT compress_chunk('_timescaledb_internal._hyper_1_2_chunk');
```

## Arguments

The syntax is:

```sql
SELECT compress_chunk(
    uncompressed_chunk = '<chunk_name>',
    if_not_compressed = true | false,
    recompress = true | false
);
```

| Name | Type | Default | Required | Description |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| `chunk_name` | REGCLASS | - | ✔ | Name of the {CHUNK} to be compressed |
| `if_not_compressed` | BOOLEAN | true | - | Disabling this will make the function error out on {CHUNK}s that are already compressed. |

## Returns

| Column | Type | Description |
|-|-|-|
| `compress_chunk` | REGCLASS | Name of the {CHUNK} that was compressed |
