import { TIMESCALE_DB, TOOLKIT_LONG, TDB_COMMUNITY } from '/snippets/vars.mdx';

The {TIMESCALE_DB} API Reference uses tags to categorize functions. The tags are `Community`, `Experimental`, `Toolkit`, and `Experimental (Toolkit)`. This section explains each tag.

## Community

This tag indicates that the function is available under TimescaleDB Community Edition, and are not available under the Apache 2 Edition. For more information, visit our [TimescaleDB License comparison sheet][tsl-comparison].

## Experimental (TimescaleDB Experimental Schema)

This tag indicates that the function is included in the TimescaleDB experimental schema. Do not use experimental functions in production. Experimental features could include bugs, and are likely to change in future versions. The experimental schema is used by {TIMESCALE_DB} to develop new features more quickly. If experimental functions are successful, they can move out of the experimental schema and go into production use.

<Warning>
When upgrading the {TIMESCALE_DB} extension, any database objects that depend on experimental features are dropped and must be recreated after the upgrade. Experimental features can change between versions and have no guarantees that they are backwards compatible.
</Warning>

For more information about the experimental schema, [read the Timescale blog post][experimental-blog].

## Toolkit

This tag indicates that the function is included in the {TOOLKIT_LONG} extension. Toolkit functions are available under {TDB_COMMUNITY}. For installation instructions, [see the installation guide][toolkit-install].

## Experimental (TimescaleDB Toolkit)

This tag is used with the Toolkit tag. It indicates a Toolkit function that is under active development. Do not use experimental toolkit functions in production. Experimental toolkit functions could include bugs, and are likely to change in future versions.

These functions might not correctly handle unusual use cases or errors, and they could have poor performance. Updates to the TimescaleDB extension drop database objects that depend on experimental features like this function. If you use experimental toolkit functions on Timescale, this function is automatically dropped when the Toolkit extension is updated. For more information, [see the TimescaleDB Toolkit docs][toolkit-docs].
