import { CHUNK, HYPERTABLE } from '/snippets/vars.mdx';

Shows information about compression settings for each {CHUNK} that has compression enabled on it.

## Samples

Show compression settings for all {CHUNK}s:

```sql
SELECT * FROM timescaledb_information.chunk_compression_settings'
hypertable               | measurements
chunk					 | _timescaledb_internal._hyper_1_1_chunk
segmentby                |
orderby                  | "time" DESC
```

Find all {CHUNK} compression settings for a specific {HYPERTABLE}:

```sql
SELECT * FROM timescaledb_information.chunk_compression_settings WHERE hypertable::TEXT LIKE 'metrics';
hypertable               | metrics
chunk					 | _timescaledb_internal._hyper_2_3_chunk
segmentby                | metric_id
orderby                  | "time"
```
