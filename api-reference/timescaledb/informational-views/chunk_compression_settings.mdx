hypertable               | measurements
chunk					 | _timescaledb_internal._hyper_1_1_chunk
segmentby                |
orderby                  | "time" DESC
```

Find all chunk compression settings for a specific hypertable:

```sql
SELECT * FROM timescaledb_information.chunk_compression_settings WHERE hypertable::TEXT LIKE 'metrics';
hypertable               | metrics
chunk					 | _timescaledb_internal._hyper_2_3_chunk
segmentby                | metric_id
orderby                  | "time"
```
