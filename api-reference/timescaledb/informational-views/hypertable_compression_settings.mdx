hypertable               | measurements
chunk                    | _timescaledb_internal._hyper_2_97_chunk
segmentby                |
orderby                  | time DESC
```

hypertable               | metrics
chunk                    | _timescaledb_internal._hyper_1_12_chunk
segmentby                | metric_id
orderby                  | time DESC
```
