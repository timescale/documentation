## Samples

Show compression settings for all {HYPERTABLE}s:

```sql
SELECT * FROM timescaledb_information.hypertable_compression_settings;
hypertable               | measurements
chunk                    | _timescaledb_internal._hyper_2_97_chunk
segmentby                |
orderby                  | time DESC
```

Find compression settings for a specific {HYPERTABLE}:

```sql
SELECT * FROM timescaledb_information.hypertable_compression_settings WHERE hypertable::TEXT LIKE 'metrics';
hypertable               | metrics
chunk                    | _timescaledb_internal._hyper_1_12_chunk
segmentby                | metric_id
orderby                  | time DESC
```
