import { HYPERTABLE, CHUNK, CAGG, TIMESCALE_DB } from '/snippets/vars.mdx';

{TIMESCALE_DB} makes complex database features like partitioning and data retention
easy to use with our comprehensive APIs. {TIMESCALE_DB} works hard to provide
detailed information about the state of your data, {HYPERTABLE}s, {CHUNK}s, and any
jobs or policies you have in place.

These views provide the data and statistics you need to keep track of your
database.

## Samples

### Get all hypertables in your database

View all {HYPERTABLE}s with their size and compression status:

```sql
SELECT hypertable_name,
       num_dimensions,
       num_chunks,
       compression_enabled,
       is_distributed
FROM timescaledb_information.hypertables;
```

### Check chunk information for a hypertable

View all {CHUNK}s for a specific {HYPERTABLE}:

```sql
SELECT chunk_name,
       range_start,
       range_end,
       is_compressed
FROM timescaledb_information.chunks
WHERE hypertable_name = 'conditions'
ORDER BY range_start DESC;
```

### Monitor background jobs

View all scheduled jobs and their status:

```sql
SELECT job_id,
       application_name,
       schedule_interval,
       last_run_status,
       next_start
FROM timescaledb_information.jobs
ORDER BY next_start;
```

### Check job execution history

View recent job runs and their success/failure status:

```sql
SELECT job_id,
       execution_start,
       execution_finish,
       succeeded,
       total_runs,
       total_failures
FROM timescaledb_information.job_stats
ORDER BY last_finish DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### View continuous aggregate details

Get information about all {CAGG}s:

```sql
SELECT view_name,
       view_definition,
       materialized_only,
       compression_enabled,
       finalized
FROM timescaledb_information.continuous_aggregates;
```

### Check compression settings

View compression settings for all {HYPERTABLE}s:

```sql
SELECT hypertable_name,
       attname AS column_name,
       orderby_column_index,
       segmentby_column_index
FROM timescaledb_information.hypertable_compression_settings
ORDER BY hypertable_name, orderby_column_index;
```
