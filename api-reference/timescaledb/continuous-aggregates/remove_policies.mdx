<Icon icon="flask" /> Early access

Remove refresh, columnstore, and data retention policies from a continuous
aggregate. The removed columnstore and retention policies apply to the
continuous aggregate, _not_ to the original hypertable.

```sql
timescaledb_experimental.remove_policies(
     relation REGCLASS,
     if_exists BOOL = false,
     VARIADIC policy_names TEXT[] = NULL
) RETURNS BOOL
```

To remove all policies on a continuous aggregate, see
[`remove_all_policies()`][remove-all-policies].

## Samples

Given a continuous aggregate named `example_continuous_aggregate` with a refresh
policy and a data retention policy, remove both policies.

Throw an error if either policy doesn't exist. If the continuous aggregate has a
columnstore policy, leave it unchanged:

```sql
SELECT timescaledb_experimental.remove_policies(
    'example_continuous_aggregate',
    false,
    'policy_refresh_continuous_aggregate',
    'policy_retention'
);
```

## Arguments

| Name | Type | Default | Required | Description |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| `relation` | `REGCLASS` | - | ✔ | The continuous aggregate to remove policies from |
| `if_exists` | `BOOL` | false | - | When true, prints a warning instead of erroring if the policy doesn't exist. |
| `policy_names` | `TEXT` | - | - | The policies to remove. You can list multiple policies, separated by a comma. Allowed policy names are `policy_refresh_continuous_aggregate`, `policy_compression`, and `policy_retention`. |

## Returns

Returns true if successful.
