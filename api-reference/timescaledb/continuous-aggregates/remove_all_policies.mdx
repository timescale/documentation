Remove all policies from a continuous aggregate. The removed columnstore and
retention policies apply to the continuous aggregate, _not_ to the original
hypertable.

```sql
timescaledb_experimental.remove_all_policies(
     relation REGCLASS,
     if_exists BOOL = false
) RETURNS BOOL
```

## Samples

Remove all policies from a continuous aggregate named
`example_continuous_aggregate`. This includes refresh policies, columnstore
policies, and data retention policies. It doesn't include custom jobs:

```sql
SELECT timescaledb_experimental.remove_all_policies('example_continuous_aggregate');
```

## Arguments

| Name | Type | Default | Required | Description |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| `relation` | `REGCLASS` | - | ✔ | The continuous aggregate to remove all policies from |
| `if_exists` | `BOOL` | false | - | When true, prints a warning instead of erroring if any policies are missing. |

## Returns

Returns true if successful.
