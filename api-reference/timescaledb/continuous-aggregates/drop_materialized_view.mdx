import { CAGG, HYPERTABLE } from '/snippets/vars.mdx';

{CAGG_CAP} views can be dropped using the `DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW` statement.

This statement deletes the {CAGG} and all its internal
objects. It also removes refresh policies for that
aggregate. To delete other dependent objects, such as a view
defined on the {CAGG}, add the `CASCADE`
option. Dropping a {CAGG} does not affect the data in
the underlying {HYPERTABLE} from which the {CAGG} is
derived.

```sql
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW <view_name>;
```

## Samples

Drop existing {CAGG}.

```sql
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW contagg_view;
```

## Arguments

| Name | Type | Default | Required | Description |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| `<view_name>` | TEXT | - | ✔ | Name (optionally schema-qualified) of {CAGG} view to be dropped. |
