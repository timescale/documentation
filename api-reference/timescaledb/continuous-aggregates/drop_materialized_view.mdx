Continuous aggregate views can be dropped using the `DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW` statement.

This statement deletes the continuous aggregate and all its internal
objects. It also removes refresh policies for that
aggregate. To delete other dependent objects, such as a view
defined on the continuous aggregate, add the `CASCADE`
option. Dropping a continuous aggregate does not affect the data in
the underlying hypertable from which the continuous aggregate is
derived.

```sql
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW <view_name>;
```

## Samples

Drop existing continuous aggregate.

```sql
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW contagg_view;
```

## Arguments

| Name | Type | Default | Required | Description |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| `<view_name>` | TEXT | - | ✔ | Name (optionally schema-qualified) of continuous aggregate view to be dropped. |
