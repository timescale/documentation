<Icon icon="flask" /> Early access

Alter refresh, columnstore, or data retention policies on a continuous
aggregate. The altered columnstore and retention policies apply to the
continuous aggregate, _not_ to the original hypertable.

```sql
timescaledb_experimental.alter_policies(
     relation REGCLASS,
     if_exists BOOL = false,
     refresh_start_offset "any" = NULL,
     refresh_end_offset "any" = NULL,
     compress_after "any" = NULL,
     drop_after "any" = NULL
) RETURNS BOOL
```

## Samples

Given a continuous aggregate named `example_continuous_aggregate` with an
existing columnstore policy, alter the columnstore policy to compress data older
than 16 days:

```sql
SELECT timescaledb_experimental.alter_policies(
    'continuous_agg_max_mat_date',
    compress_after => '16 days'::interval
);
```

## Arguments

| Name | Type | Default | Required | Description |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| `relation` | `REGCLASS` | - | ✔ | The continuous aggregate that you want to alter policies for |
| `if_not_exists` | `BOOL` | false | - | When true, prints a warning instead of erroring if the policy doesn't exist. |
| `refresh_start_offset` | `INTERVAL` or `INTEGER` | - | - | The start of the continuous aggregate refresh window, expressed as an offset from the policy run time. |
| `refresh_end_offset` | `INTERVAL` or `INTEGER` | - | - | The end of the continuous aggregate refresh window, expressed as an offset from the policy run time. Must be greater than `refresh_start_offset`. |
| `compress_after` | `INTERVAL` or `INTEGER` | - | - | Continuous aggregate chunks are compressed into the columnstore if they exclusively contain data older than this interval. |
| `drop_after` | `INTERVAL` or `INTEGER` | - | - | Continuous aggregate chunks are dropped if they exclusively contain data older than this interval. |

For arguments that could be either an `INTERVAL` or an `INTEGER`, use an
`INTERVAL` if your time bucket is based on timestamps. Use an `INTEGER` if your
time bucket is based on integers.

## Returns

Returns true if successful.
